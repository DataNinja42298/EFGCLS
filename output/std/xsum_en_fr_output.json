'' the fed said in a statement that the pace of improvement in the labour market had slowed . the bank added , however , that `` economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labour market indicators will strengthen '' even with gradual rate increases . analysis : andrew walker , bbc news the key consideration in this decision was the us jobs market - with a little help from the uncertainties arising from the forthcoming british referendum and a few other factors . we have had two months where job creation has been disappointing , especially may . the fed chair janet yellen called it `` something of a loss of momentum '' . but she also said signs there were signs that the labour market is `` approaching maximum employment '' and it 's important not to attach too much importance to one data point . she - and , she said , the fed 's policy making committee - did not feel that `` progress in the labour market has come to an end '' . which leaves us -lrb- or at least me -rrb- having to pore over the next jobs report to see how likely a rate rise is in july . at this stage it does n't look very likely , but it is not altogether off the table . the dollar fell against the euro and sterling , but wall street held on to earlier gains , with the s&p 500 up 0.3 % . the fed expected the unemployment rate to stand at 4.7 % by the end of this year , before falling to 4.6 % in 2017 and remain at that level in 2018 . in may , us job creation fell to its lowest level in more than five years , after faltering in april . ms yellen said it was important not to overreact to one or two monthly readings . `` that said , we will be watching the job market carefully , '' she added . the fed now expects the us economy to expand by only 2 % a year for the foreseeable future - slightly lower than the forecast in march . brian jacobsen of wells fargo funds management said : `` it 's as dovish as the fed can get without actually cutting rates . '' aaron kohli of bmo capital markets agreed that the statement appeared `` somewhat dovish '' , adding : `` the market had expected them to moderate their tone a little bit given what 's been going on and given the risk that we have in terms of brexit .
