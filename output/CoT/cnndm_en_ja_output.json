The France international was given a second yellow card for the offence, but head coach John Carver feels it should have been a straight red. 'The club will deal with that situation,' he said when asked if Sissoko - who is now banned for two matches - would be punished. Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva clutches his leg after Moussa Sissoko's tackle at Anfield Sissoko hands the captain's armband to boss John Carver as he leaves the pitch after being sent off 'He knows he was wrong. He was fortunate not to get a straight red and he agreed with me. 'He apologised afterwards to Lucas, which was important. 'But you think captains would lead by example. We have to improve our discipline. I will be looking at that.' Meanwhile, Carver says Newcastle cannot rely on the shortcomings of others to preserve their Premier League status. The Magpies are the division's most out-of-form side having lost five on the spin, scoring just one goal along the way. Liverpool's players surround Lucas following Sissoko's dangerous tackle during Monday night's game Raheem Sterling bends the ball past Tim Krul to open the scoring in Liverpool's 2-0 win against Newcastle They are nine points clear of danger with six matches to play, but Carver says it's about time they started helping themselves, starting with Sunday's visit of Spurs. 'These two home games (Spurs followed by Swansea) are massive for us. I'm not bothered about performances, we need results,' he said. 'I'm not worrying about that (relegation) at the moment, and the good thing is we have four games at home. 'But we need to start winning now. We can't rely on others teams. We can't afford to ease off, I have always said that. 'We have gone through a rough spell. It's down to me now to get players in right frame of mind.' Newcastle's players appear dejected as Joe Allen celebrates scoring Liverpool's second goal at Anfield",

The fast food giant has caused fury after installing metal studs outside its branch in Leeds city centre, which critics say are there to stop people  sleeping rough. McDonald's has defended the use of the spikes, claiming they were installed two years ago in an attempt to stop anti-social behaviour, not target the homeless. Uproar: A petition has been started to get the spikes removed from outside this Leeds McDonald's and 70,000 have backed the campaign But critics say they have been put in because they are uncomfortable to sleep on and installed on areas which used to be benches. Isobella DeMartino set up the petition to have them removed and has received support from across the globe.  Row: Critics say the spikes were installed to target the homeless but McDonald's say it is only about anti-social behaviour 'Anti-homeless spikes show complete disregard and lack of respect for homeless people who struggle every day,' she said. 'Spikes have been installed, presumably to prevent people sleeping there. 'The fact that the spikes exist shows how little people care about homeless people.' She added: 'Every time I'm in Leeds I see many ignore homeless people, not even bothering to smile at them let alone try to help them or give charity. I cannot imagine how painful and lonely it must be to be homeless. 'They deserve our attention and care, this issue cannot be ignored.' A spokeswoman for McDonald's said: 'The studs in question are not an 'anti- homeless' measure, as has been suggested. 'They have been in place for around two years and were introduced Following discussions with the police, in response to issues we were experiencing with antisocial behaviour. 'We welcome all customers through our doors and it is inaccurate to suggest a measure taken in response to tackling antisocial behaviour, is an attempt to deter homeless people.'",

The Nantucket wooden chair, which once sat on a first-class promenade of the ill-fated ship, was salvaged by a search team from the Atlantic Ocean after the Titanic sank in 1912.  Dubbed 'one of the rarest types of Titanic collectable', the chair is too fragile to sit on, but has been carefully preserved, having been owned by a British collector for the past 15 years. A 103-year-old deckchair recovered from the wreck of the Titanic is expected sold for \u00a3100,000 at auction The ship's log records six or seven deckchairs being picked up and taken back to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia. One was given by a crew member to Captain Julien Lemarteleur, who had previously worked on board the Mackay-Bennett.  The anonymous seller kept it by a large window overlooking the sea at his home on the south coast, never sat on it due to its fragile state and instead used it as a display item.  It was sold yesterday at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Devizes, Wiltshire, to a UK buyer.  Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, described the piece as one of 'the most important [bits] of Titanic memorabilia around'.   He said: 'It is incredibly rare to find something of that size that was on Titanic, was salvaged and that still exists today. Six or seven recovered deckchairs were stacked on the deck of the Mackay-Bennett as it arrived in Nova Scotia Titanic (above) sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14 It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic He said that he was 'very, very pleased' with the price. The chair is made of teak wood and has an adjustable footrest at the front. It is 57 inches long, 23 inches wide and 35 inches tall. It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic.  Upon his death in 1973, Capt Lemarteleur gave the chair to colleague Captain Robin Lee. The current owner acquired it in 2001. Sold with the chair was an in depth 'provenance package' that authenticates history and association with Titanic. Captain Julien Lemarteleur (above), who collected the chair from the Mackay-Bennett more than 100 years ago It includes a signed affidavit from Margarete Pennington, who was Mr Lemarteleur's housekeeper in the 1960s. In it she states: 'I personally saw the deckchair that Captain Lemarteleur told me about on many occasions. He said that various pieces of debris taken from the ocean including this Titanic deckchair he acquired. 'I recognise the chair as the same chair I saw in the captain's garage and of which the captain identified as coming from the Titanic.' Craig Sopin, 57, a lawyer from Philadelphia, owns one of the world's largest collections of Titanic memorabilia. He also authenticated the chair and said: 'It isn't often that one has the opportunity to acquire such an important part of Titanic's story. 'For such a significant item to have such a meticulous chain of custody is nothing short of astonishing. Its history can be traced from the auction house back to Titanic itself.' Titanic sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14. A ship, the Carpathia, picked up more than 700 survivors in lifeboats hours later and took them back to New York. White Star Line chartered four ships, including the Halifax-based cable-laying vessel the Mackay-Bennett, to recover the bodies.",

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.",

      "src": "The Wikipedia official who accused Grant Shapps of doctoring his own online biography was exposed yesterday as a former Liberal Democrat member. The Tory party chairman had been accused this week of using an anonymous user ID to delete embarrassing facts about his past and add unflattering details about his political rivals. But yesterday it emerged that the senior Wikipedia administrator who investigated the allegations - following a tip-off from the left-wing Guardian - was a former Lib-Dem member. Richard Symonds, 29, who goes by the online name 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry', is one of the UK's top administrators for the website. He once described himself as 'Liberal Democrat to the last'. Scroll down for video  Volunteer: Richard Symonds, who joined the Wikipedia project in 2004, says he was not being political Mr Symonds decided to block a user called 'Contribsx' on Tuesday after concluding the account was probably operated either by Mr Shapps or under his 'clear direction'. Mr Shapps angrily denied the claims, insisting the story was 'untrue from start to finish'. Mr Symonds' decision was also criticised by other Wikipedia activists, who warned that the site should not be used to 'play politics' and referred the case to an internal arbitration committee. One user wrote: 'I don't know if 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry' did anything wrong but it's just rather obscure, and doing this during the peak campaign time for the UK 2015 elections as some sort of assignment from a journalist seems odd.' Mr Symonds, from Bow, East London, described himself on Twitter as 'Liberal Democrat (to the last)' before deleting his profile yesterday. He joined other party members who signed a letter to The Guardian in January last year calling for Lord Rennard to have the Lib-Dem whip withdrawn over his refusal to apologise for making unwanted advances to female activists. The internet expert, who has served in the Royal Naval Reserve, has been a Wikipedia volunteer since 2004 and became an administrator for the website in 2007. He is also a paid employee of Wikimedia UK, a charity which promotes the volunteer-written encyclopedia. Furious denials: Grant Shapps yesterday continued to deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes Among his Facebook friends is Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who married Tony Blair's former diary secretary Kate Garvey in 2012. He was once featured in a BBC profile that called him 'one of the UK's top Wikipedians' and reported that he spent up to eight hours a day working on the site. Responding to the criticism yesterday, Mr Symonds insisted he was not a Lib-Dem activist and said he would never let his political views interfere with his Wikipedia work. He added: 'I have never considered myself 'active' in any party, although I have been a lapsed member of the Lib Dems on and off, for probably a year in total since 2010.' Mr Symonds toned down his conclusions about Mr Shapps' possible connections to 'Contribsx', revisions to one of his Wikipedia pages show. At first he claimed the Tory chairman ran the account either directly or indirectly, but later he changed this to suggest simply that the account was run by a user called 'Hackneymarsh' who was linked to Mr Shapps' office by The Guardian in 2012. Mr Symonds admitted that Wikipedia's top officials had 'chastised' him for his handling of the case, although he refused to back down yesterday. He said: 'While a link has clearly been drawn between Hackneymarsh and Contribsx, it is impossible to know who was sitting behind the keyboard of Contribsx. 'But given the nature of edits, I suspect that it was Mr Shapps or someone close to him.' The Liberal Democrats used the claims to poke fun at the Tory chairman when the story broke on Tuesday night, and senior figures in the party continued mocking him yesterday. Lib-Dem leader Nick Clegg said he believed the denials but then joked that the person behind the account could have been 'Michael Green', the pseudonym used by Mr Shapps to promote get-rich-quick schemes before he became an MP. A Lib-Dem spokesman said Mr Symonds had 'no connection to Lib Dem HQ'. 'The first time we saw this story was in the Guardian, and the first time we know about him was when we were asked about him this afternoon,' he added. Minister Justine Greening, left, and Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby, right, were among those mentioned in the Wikipedia edits Mr Shapps yesterday continued to furiously deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes, and Tory cabinet ministers rallied behind him. He said: 'It's categorically untrue. It's absolutely nothing to do with me. It's just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.' David Cameron came to his defence, insisting the Welwyn Hatfield MP was doing a 'great job'. Wikimedia UK spokesman Stevie Benton said to the best of his knowledge Mr Symonds did not brief the Liberal Democrats about his actions. 'I would be incredibly surprised if he had done and would say it's out of character,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'I've worked with Richard for three and a half years and his politics have never entered into anything in that time.' The Guardian rejected criticism that its story did not made it plain that it had prompted the Wikipedia inquiry into alleged links between 'Contribsx' and Mr Shapps. A spokeswoman for the paper said: 'The article clearly states that this was a Guardian investigation which brought to light some potential breaches of Wikipedia's own rules, which were then communicated to the site's administrators.' Unite leader Len McCluskey has become embroiled in a claim against his trade union for bullying and sexual harassment. As part of a constructive dismissal claim under investigation by an employment tribunal, former union official Sally Nailard has accused the Unite general secretary of calling her a 'scab'. The 50-year-old former regional officer based at Heathrow is seeking undisclosed compensation. The case lifts the lid on alleged 'discrimination, misogyny and bullying' at the hard-Left union. The chairman of the employment tribunal in Watford, Isabel Manley, described the case as a 'sad and sorry tale'. More than half of Labour candidates in its 106 target seats are linked to Unite. Mr McCluskey is one of several union officials cited in Miss Nailard's claim. She resigned from her \u00a347,000 position last August, following an alleged 18-month campaign of bullying and harassment. Her evidence submitted to the tribunal, seen by the Independent, relates to a copy of an interview she gave to Sky News in 1997 after a cabin crew strike which she didn't take part in.

Elijah McKenna suffered two wide, bloody gashes on his back of his head and numerous deep bite marks all over his face and body after his neighbor's three dogs attacked him near his grandmother's home in Moore, Oklahoma, Saturday. But the child's family say if it were not for Elijah's fearless 9-year-old sister, Alyssa, the special-needs boy most likely would have been dead. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Scroll down for video   Heroic: Alyssa McKenna, 9 (right), saved her 11-year-old brother, Elijah (left) from a pack of vicious dogs  Horrific injuries: The child, who is hearing-impaired, suffered deep cuts to his head (left) that required 40 staples (left) and injuries to his face (left)  Mauled: The young boy was left with numerous deep bite marks all over his body  Vicious: This is one off the rottweilers believed to have attacked Elijah McKenna Saturday. As of Monday, they were still seen in a neighbor's yard  Alyssa says she went outside to check on her sibling, who is deaf, when she heard his screams and spotted a trio of large rottweilers biting the child in the brush by a dirt road. Setting aside concerns for her own safety, Alyssa ran over and scared off the hounds so she could tend to Elijah. The wounded boy could stand up or walk on his own, so his little sister picked him up and carried him home. 'I was terrified, but I saved his life,' Alyssa told News Channel 4. When Elijah was brought to a nearby hospital for treatment, he immediately went into surgery. The injured child, who turned 11 Tuesday, was later released home with 40 staples on his head. He is now learning to walk again. Justice: Rhianna Bravenec (right), Alyssa and Elijah's mother, said she wants all three dogs euthanized Strong: The 9-year-old girl picked up her big brother and carried him home because he was unable to walk on his own after the attack  In recovery: Elijah, who celebrated his 11th birthday Tuesday, is now learning how to walk again  On Monday, the animals that attacked Elijah were still seen roaming around the neighbor's yard. Dog owner Martin Tidwell said that what happened to the 9-year-old was terrible. Rhianna Bravenec, Alyssa and Elijah's mother, said she wants all three dogs euthanized. The woman has another young daughter and a fourth child on the way. Tidwell said he has to wait until the end of a mandatory 10-day quarantine to put his pets down. Under state law, Tidwell is not required to euthanize his animals, but the man said he feels morally obligated to do so. Elijah's family have set up a GoFundMe account hoping to raise $5,000 to help with his mounting medical bills.",

The technology, which is still under development, could be a step towards uploading memories and personalities into computers, allowing people to live on in virtual reality. Almost everyone longs to be reunited with deceased friends and family. Now an app dubbed 'Project Elysium' claims to do just that by creating a 'personalised afterlife experience' with loved ones who have passed. The app's developers have yet to reveal exactly how the technology will work Created by Australia-based Paranormal Games, the app's developers have yet to reveal exactly how the technology will work. What little we do know comes from their Twitter account, which features a screenshot showing someone being transformed into a 3D model. An accompanying caption says: 'Modelling my bestie and business partner Nick into Project Elysium. Our first demo will be personal to Nick.' Dr Albert Rizzo, director of medical virtual reality at the University of Southern California said he believes potential users would have to send pictures and video of the deceased to the developer. What little we do know comes from their Twitter account, which features a screenshot showing someone being transformed into a 3D model. An accompanying caption says: 'Modelling my bestie and business partner Nick into Project Elysium. Our first demo will be personal to Nick' But the company may also need to harvest even more data so that they can construct the person's personality, mannerisms and movements. 'If I knew I had an incurable disease, maybe I would do a full body scan and have a digital replica created,' Dr Rizzo told DailyMail.com. 'And I would sit down for 20 hours and have people ask me questions about my life and what I think about different things.' He says this can all be programmed into virtual reality to create a living record of someone that people can interact with using VR headsets such as Oculus Rift. But experts are divided over how this can impact a user's mental health. Some argue that it can provide real comfort and support in times of grief, while others say it may prevent people from moving on from trauma. Bina48 is a robotic head that uses a 'Mind Clone' of the memories, belief and feelings of a real person It may be possible to live forever by uploading your memories, thoughts and personality onto a computer within the next ten or twenty years, according to a leading pioneer of the technology. The technology, which is similar to that seen in the film Transcendence starring Johnny Depp, is being developed by entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt. She has already created a disturbingly realistic robotic 'clone' of her wife Bina that she hopes will be a prototype for the technology. The robot apparently shares the ideas and personality of Bina by creating a database of her memories, beliefs and thoughts, along with information taken from social media interactions and blogs she shares. This allows the robot, called Bina48, to express opinions and interact in conversations like a real, living person. Mrs Rothblatt, 60, an internet radio entrepreneur who lives as a transgender woman, believes the these 'Mind Clones' could eventually be used to help provide social interactions for people living alone and even help recreate the personalities of people after they have died. 'I think helping people to confront difficult emotional challenges done in a safe environment is a positive thing,' said Dr Rizzo. 'When people avoid processing things, this is when it comes back and haunts them.' 'I don't think there is any disrespect to the dead to want to view them and interact with them,' he added.

Douglas Mark Hughes, 61, created a security scare when he violated national airspace and has prompted a full-scale security review in Washington. Hughes, a US Postal Service mail carrier, described his flight upon arriving home in Ruskin, Florida, early on Sunday. Scroll down for video  Doug Hughes, 61, spoke from his home in Ruskin, Florida, afre he arrived for house arrest before his court date He steered his one-person gyrocopter onto the West Lawn of the US Capitol on Wednesday, April 15, 2015 Doug Hughes putting address labels on half of the 535 letters to Congress he tried delivering earlier this month Hughes told reporters outside his home: 'I had expected to be intercepted on the way.' He recalled it being colder than he had expected flying from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to DC, where the sight of the Washington Monument helped guide him to the Capitol grounds. Some of the people below waved to Hughes, who intended the flight as a protest to highlight the need for campaign-finance reform, as he flew over the National Mall.  He said: 'People were not frightened at all. 'That part of it was surreal.' Hughes hoped to raise awareness about the influence of big money in politics by deliberately breaking the law to deliver 535 letters, one for each member of Congress.  Instead, the overwhelming focus of news coverage has been about the gaps he exposed in national security. He told The Associated Press: 'We've got bigger problems in this country than worrying about whether the security around DC is ironclad. 'We need to be worried about the piles of money that are going into Congress. 'The message was two pages long to Congress that they are going to have to face the issue, OK, of campaign-finance reform and honesty and government so that they work for the people.  Hughes flew through restricted airspace carrying 535 letters and landed on the west lawn of the Capitol His Russian-born wife, Alena Hughes, said she was 'proud' that her husband acted out of patriotism for the US Hughes spent a night in jail after Capitol Police arrested him.  The ultralight aircraft and its cargo - a US Postal Service bin carrying the letters - were seized.  His Russian-born wife, Alena, told the AP that her husband acted out of patriotism for the United States. She said: 'I am very proud of my husband. He is a countryman.' Hughes faces up to four years in prison on charges of unlawfully operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national defense airspace. He will remain home until he is back in Washington for a preliminary hearing in May Asked if he too thinks he's a patriot or simply crazy, Hughes said 'everyone gets to make up their own mind about me, that's what I'd say.' A reporter asked: 'But do you consider yourself a patriot?' 'No, I'm a mailman,' he said. Hughes faces up to four years in prison on charges of unlawfully operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national defense airspace. He was allowed to return to Florida, but ordered to remain at home in detention until he is due back in Washington for a preliminary hearing on May 8.",

      "src": "Charity runners taking part in a 10km fun run at the weekend were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour. The blunder was believed to have been caused by a race marshal taking a toilet break during the event, missing 300 runners who should have been directed at a junction point. Instead they continued past the unmanned marshall point and had to run for an extra three kilometres while the other 900 competitors followed the correct route. Scroll down for video  Blunder: Charity runners taking part in yesterday's Bournemouth Bay 10K Run (pictured) were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour The bizarre gaffe happened during yesterday's Bournemouth Bay Run and today the organisers - Bournemouth Borough Council - appealed for those who were affected by the mix-up to contact them for a 'gesture of goodwill.' A local authority spokesman said that it was investigating what happened to the marshal who should have directed runners at a turning point. It was reported that some runners were 'in tears' while one described the event's organisation as 'shambolic'.  Hayley James, who is four months pregnant and from Poole, said: 'To have a race of that scale with only one marshal on a point is inexcusable. 'We saw loads of people walking at the end, some were in tears, I felt so sorry for them - I felt like crying at the 10km mark.' Andy Isaac, from Bournemouth, said the event was 'mayhem' with one point where an elderly woman managed to drive onto the route and was flashing her lights at oncoming runners.  A map shows where up to 300 runners continued along the coastal path after a marshal who was meant to direct them on to a turn went to the toilet Reaction: Two people vent their frustration at the Bournemouth Bay Run on Twitter yesterday It also emerged that water stations ran out of supplies during the race, forcing some runners to drink from half-empty bottles that had been left on the ground as they battled against dehydration. Commenting on the Daily Echo website, one runner said: \"We had a bottle of water at the three mile station, but at the six mile point they had totally ran out, so nothing. Jon Weaver, head of resort marketing and events at the council, said: 'Unfortunately there was some confusion with marshalling arrangements at one point, but it was a critical point. We apologise unreservedly to those front runners. 'In 33 years of running... this is the first time this has happened and as part of our debrief we will be analysing the arrangements carefully... to learn for 2016. 'We understand runners have trained for a long time for the event and it's hard for them and we do empathise with how they are feeling.' It was hoped that the event would have raised more than \u00a370,000 for the British Heart Foundation.  Some racers took to Twitter to vent their frustration over the blunder. Rob Kelly wrote: Really disappointed in the #BournemouthBayRun 10k that ended up 13k very poor show bad marshalling #wontbeback.' AndKim Kelly replied: 'Totally agree and never got to do a 5k as they were 45mins behind schedule :(((.'",

Remy Dufrene, 3, of Raceland, Louisiana, was in the kitchen with his grandmother when he ran out the back door as she was pouring him a glass of milk.  The old woman tried to chase after the young boy, but soon after there was a loud scream as he fell into the drainage ditch. Scroll down for video Remy Dufrene (above) drowned after falling into a drainage ditch Tuesday afternoon His father searched for the boy's body but it took him 15 minutes to find his son in the ditch (above) 'As soon as I pulled him out, his pour little belly looked like it was full of water, and kind of knew when I pulled him out that he was gone,' said Drake Dufrene (above) the boy's father 'He just ran out the front door to back here, and my mom, she's ill, she can't keep up with a 3-year-old,' Drake Dufrene, the boy's father, told CBS 4.  'I just heard a very, very distinct, scary scream.' Duferene, who was in the bathroom at the time, ran outside and jumped into the water to try and look for his son, but it took him 15 minutes before he was able to find the boy.  'As soon as I pulled him out, his pour little belly looked like it was full of water, and kind of knew when I pulled him out that he was gone,' he said.  Emergency workers on the scene spent almost an hour trying to resuscitate the boy to no avail. The family now says they are taking comfort knowing that their boy is in a better place, but are still in shock 'It's just, it's tragic. I hope never anyone has to go through what I'm going through right now, because I've never felt anything this hard in my life,' said the boy's father (above with his mother) Making matters worse, this might have never been an issue were it not for the weather. 'That ditch is almost dry all the time,' said Samuel Dufrene, the boy's grand granfather. 'With this rain we've been having, there's a lot of water, and they were pumping hard.'

      "src": "A Tory councillor with a history of odd behaviour was told to put down his knife and fork after being caught tucking into a roast duck dinner during a council meeting. Jonny Bucknell, 58, was enjoying his meal in the council chamber when a Labour rival, Theo Blackwell, spotted him and alerted other councillors. He was forced to put down his cutlery when the mayor, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, interrupted the proceedings to tell him off. Taking a stand: Jonny Bucknell is no stranger to odd behaviour. In 2013 he slept in his car at the Tory party conference. He now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetings The mayor, who was chairing the meeting of Camden Council in north London, reminded the hungry councillor that eating was banned in the chamber. But the angry diner claims he was unaware eating there was forbidden and said he now aims to campaign for a rule change. The rumpus comes a month after Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Elengorn was caught playing Scrabble during a Richmond Council budget meeting in south-west London. Telling off: Mayor of Camden Council, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, had to tell Mr Bucknell to stop eating When he first noticed him eating, Mr Blackwell told his fellow councillors: 'It appears that one of our Tory colleagues is consuming a full Sunday roast dinner in the council chamber. 'Could I ask the borough solicitor to give us advice on eating a full roast dinner in the council chamber? It's a little bit more than a cheeky Snickers.' The diner was forced to curtail his meal. Mr Bucknell, who has been a councillor for more than ten years and represents Belsize, Hampstead, told the Evening Standard: 'I never knew there was a ban on eating in the chamber. 'They should definitely repeal it. There is nothing wrong with nibbling from a lunch box if you are being discreet. 'It is not as if a cold meal is going to waft around like a McDonald's. 'I will be campaigning for the repealing of the law that says you can't nibble from a lunch box in the council chamber.' The Conservative councillor said the meal, in a plastic box, had travelled home with him after a French snowboarding holiday. 'The chalet always brought out too much food and I can't stand wasting food,' he said. He previously found fame when he slept in his Volvo car to save on hotel bills during the Conservative party conference in September 2013. Mr Bucknell said at the time it was to make a stand against what he called 'ridiculous prices'. He said the economy would improve if more people were thrifty like him.  After the council meeting mayor Lazzaro Pietragnoli said: 'I understand councillors do a difficult job and sometimes don't get time to eat dinner. 'I also tend to be quite flexible, but having a big meal in front of him - that was a bit too much.' A Camden Council spokesman said: 'It is as the mayor said, standing orders say that members should not eat in the chamber.' No eating: The Camden Council chamber where Councillor Bucknell was forced to curtail his roast dinner",

The screening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development. By looking for distinctive 'breath prints', researchers were also able to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease. Scroll down for video  In and out: Thanks to a breath test, researchers claim there were able to detect the early stages of stomach cancer and also to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease (stock image) Israeli researchers say the system is accurate, cheap \u2013 and allows patients to be monitored without using invasive procedures. The discovery comes as scientists in the US made a breakthrough that could lead a test to flag up the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer. A protein has been identified which seems to play a crucial role in the rapid growth of tumours. The breath test discovery is hoped to save thousands of lives. About 7,000 people develop stomach cancer in the UK each year and most of these cases are in the advanced stages when they are diagnosed. Research leader Professor Hossam Haick of the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute in Haifa, said: 'The attraction of this test lies in its non-invasiveness, ease of use, rapid predictiveness, insensitivity to confounding factors, and potentially low cost.' Breathe: The tscreening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development (stock image) Previous research has found that other methods could be used to identify stomach cancer, but none looked at detecting pre-cancerous changes. In the study published online in the journal Gut, breath samples were taken from 484 people, including 99 already diagnosed with stomach cancer. They were analysed by so-called nanomaterial sensors, which are able to read a chemical signal or pattern linked with stomach cancer based on very small particles in a patient's breath. The test is so accurate it could detect the difference between early and late stage gastric cancers. The researchers hope the breath test could be used as an alternative to endoscopies, an invasive and expensive procedure to diagnose gastric cancers using a long flexible tube.  A large trial involving thousands of patients, including those with stomach cancer or pre-cancerous changes, is currently under way in Europe to test the technology's suitability as a screening method, they add. Meanwhile, US experts say the discovery of a new biomarker protein may one day lead to a test which differentiates men with aggressive prostate cancer from those with a less threatening form of the disease. The findings, published in the scientific journal Oncogene, raises hope of tests that deliver an accurate diagnosis from the outset. The results could lead to more targeted treatment for those with the worst cancers \u2013 and less treatment for men whose tumours are not dangerous. Professor Renny Franceschi, of the University of Michigan, said it paves the way for a 'warning light' that signals how dangerous the cancer is. It might also one day lead to a treatment which stops tumours growing. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, with 40,000 diagnosed in Britain every year. Current tests only identify whether a tumour is likely to be present. But they are unreliable, holding a high risk of 'false positives' that wrongly identify healthy men as having cancer. Professor Franceschi said that if further research proves positive, eventually it might lead to a test involving a simple biopsy when the patient first complains of symptoms.",

      "src": "Rangers boss Stuart McCall  ordered his side to end their stuttering away form at Dumbarton on Saturday to ramp up the pressure on play-off rivals Hibs. The Ibrox boss watched his side drop two points against bottom side Livingston in West Lothian but insisted the 1-1 draw \u2014 with Myles Hippolyte and Marius Zaliukas trading goals \u2014 could end up being crucial in the quest to finish second. Rangers have only won once in their last five away matches and McCall insists nothing less than a victory will do at the Bet Butler Stadium this weekend as his side aim to go four clear in second while Hibs face Falkirk in the Scottish Cup semi finals. Stuart McCall wants his side to put their away-day blues behind them at Dumbarton on Saturday 'We could be four ahead on Saturday night so that might be a very important point for us tonight,' said McCall on a night when Rangers fans let off a series of fireworks in the Energy Assets Arena. 'It's still in our hands \u2014 but we have got to go and win on Saturday! 'Of course I'm disappointed not to win the game. We didn't deserve any more but this wasn't a case of us blowing hot and cold. We've no divine right to come here and win. 'I said before the game this would be a tough place to come. OK, we didn't play as fluently as we would have liked but Livvy were fighting for their lives. They are a physical side and Hibs and Queen of the South have still to come here. Rangers dropped two points at Championship bottom side Livingston in their bid for promotion Myles Hippolyte gave Livingston the lead early in the second half and threatened to upset Rangers 'It was a game that panned out the way I expected on a tight park, dry and bumpy. It was a fair result. You can't stop a free kick like that (by Hippolyte).' Meanwhile, Mark Burchill was left ruing a first half 'goal' by Hippolyte that was chalked off after a supposed foul by Jordan White on Cammy Bell. But the Livvy boss was also left lamenting his team's dire defending 120 seconds after taking the lead through Hippolyte's fine freekick. 'I think everyone here knows it should have been a goal by Myles in the first half,' he sighed. Marius Zaliukas equalised a couple of minutes later for Rangers at the Energy Assets Arena 'I'm just really disappointed. It was a terrible goal for us to lose. If you go ahead in a match you really want to do better than that. When you've taken the lead that's your most vulnerable time as a team. And I just feel if we had weathered that then Rangers would have run out of ideas. 'It was not the best we have played but I felt we more than matched Rangers tonight. I watched them on Sunday against Raith and I thought we could get three points from them and I'm disappointed we never managed to do that.'",

In December West Brom were two goals up but lost to a Charlie Austin hat-trick, leading to Barton's scathing judgement and plunging Alan Irvine to the brink of the sack. Barton said then: 'West Brom went 2-0 up and I turned to Dunney (Richard Dunne) and said, 'they've scored too early.' They don't know how to get over the finishing line.' Tony Pulis has admitted that Joey Barton 'probably had a point' about West Brom losing their cool The outspoken midfielder (right) was commenting after West Brom surrendered a two-goal lead  The teams meet again at the Hawthorns on Saturday with Pulis having instilled a solid core to the point Albion have not conceded after scoring first in a game. 'Whatever Joey says or whatever he does he's entitled to hid views and his opinions,' Pulis said. 'The club were 2-0 up and lost 3-2 so he most probably had a point, or he felt he had a point to say something on that subject.' Pulis recalled his own misfortune from leading 2-0 and losing as Gillingham manager in the Second Division play-off final of 1999. 'I've managed teams that have been 2-0 up with only for or five minutes to go and ended up drawing then losing on penalties. 1999 Man City Wembley,' he added. 'So I can't talk about being indestructible in respect to leads. 'We've played really well I don't think they've just been good results. The performances have been really, really good. We're hoping we'll continue that now.'

William Schultz (left) was arrested Sunday afternoon, hours after Jordan Almgren (right) was stabbed to death in his home in Discovery Bay Schultz was arrested at a hospital in Antioch at 3pm. Contra Costa County sheriff's spokesman Jimmy Lee said a nurse who saw media coverage of the case recognized the wanted suspect. Officials didn't say what Schultz was being treated for and the motive for the stabbing remains under investigation. The day before the stabbing, deputies had also been called to the home (right) on Saturday on a request for a psychological evaluation of Schultz Deputies were told on the police radio that the victim had been stabbed in the neck, reports the San Francisco Gate.  The day before the stabbing, deputies had also been called to the home on a request for a psychological evaluation of Schultz. Neighbors say five children lived there and it is believed Schultz may have been friends with one of the older siblings, reports ABC7. Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Ken Westermann said that the attack wasn't accidental The Contra Costa Times reports the stabbing occurred mere yards from the school the younger boy attended. Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Ken Westermann said that the attack wasn't accidental. 'This wasn't a random act. This wasn't some sort of stranger that came into the home and murdered a child. This was a family friend,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle.  'This little guy was the most energetic on the team,' said Almgren's Little League coach Mike De Lambert told KCRA. 'Great smile. And he was infectious, in a positive way, to everybody that he came in contact with.' Discovery Bay is a waterfront community along the banks of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",

The Biancoceleste, who have scored 18 goals and conceded just one in their last six Italian league games, will attempt to solidify their grip on second place. A victory would leave them nine points behind Juve with seven games remaining. Lazio, lead by Miroslav Klose and Felipe Anderson, have won eight games in a row in Serie A Head coach Stefano Pioli says his side will go 'all out for victory' against Juventus on Saturday Juventus are unbeaten at home this season but they did slip to just their second defeat of the campaign last weekend in a major upset at bottom-side Parma. 'I'm satisfied with what we have done,' Lazio coach Stefano Pioli said to the Italian press. However, he stressed: 'We have not achieved anything yet. 'We need to continue to work with focus. 'There are many games left to play before we can celebrate. 'Against Juve we will try to go all out for victory. 'We don't want to have any regrets after the game.' The clash with Lazio comes at the start of a challenging week for Juve. Massimiliano Allegri's team travels to Montecarlo on Tuesday for the return leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Monaco holding a 1-0 advantage. The Bianconeri will then take on Torino four days later in the Turin derby. Felipe Andrson celebrates after scoring during the 4-0 rout against Empoli last Sunday Lazio face Massimiliano Allegri's (pictured) Juventus, and will cut the gap to nine points with victory Roma have won just two of their last eight league games to fall to third in the standings, one point adrift of Lazio. The Giallorossi hold the last Champions League qualifying spot and host Atalanta on Sunday. At the other end of the table, bottom-side Parma go into Sunday's match at Empoli following another major blow. The club was docked four points on Thursday as punishment related to their financial troubles. Parma had already been hit with a three-point deduction earlier this season for failing to pay players. The latest setback has left Parma 18 points adrift of safety with 24 points still up for grabs. Napoli, seven points behind Roma, take on relegation-threatened Cagliari in Sardinia. Rafael Benitez's side won 4-1 triumph at Wolfsburg in the first leg of its Europa League quarter-final tie Thursday. Fiorentina are one place and one point behind Napoli and host Hellas Verona on Monday. The Viola were also involved in Europa League action this week and held Dynamo Kiev to a 1-1 draw in the opening leg in Ukraine. Napoli will be looking to build on their impressive Europa League win against Hellas Verona on Monday Sampdoria, who host third-bottom Cesena on Saturday, are unbeaten at their Luigi Ferraris stadium this season. Inter Milan and AC Milan clash at the San Siro on Sunday night. AC Milan are ninth in the standings, one place an one point clear of Inter and seven points adrift of the Europa League qualifying places. Torino have clinched seven points of a possible nine in their last three games to remain in contention for European football next season . The Granata are in eighth place and play at Sassuolo on Sunday. A win over Genoa on Sunday would be enough for Palermo to defend their Serie A status. The Sicilian club have collected 38 points so far to move 16 points clear of the drop zone. Udinese, without a victory since March 8 and in the midst of a five-match winless streak, travel to Verona to face Chievo. Both Inter and AC Milan are struggling for form ahead of this weekend's derby match",

Paul Monk, 54, from Essex, was wanted by Spanish police for questioning over the kidnap and murder of Francis Brennan, whose badly decomposed body washed up on a Costa Blanca beach in March last year. He was also wanted by the Metropolitan Police on drug offences and had been named on a list of fugitives published as part of the National Crime Agency's Operation Captura campaign ahead of his detention. This is the dramatic moment that fugitive Paul Monk was arrested by heavily armed police in his Alicante villa Paul Monk, 54, from Essex, was wanted by Spanish police for questioning over the kidnap and murder of Francis Brennan Spanish police released footage of their dramatic swoop. This grab for the video shows them approaching the villa at speed The police move steathily up the steps of Monk's villa, weapons drawn Taking no chances: The highly trained, well-armed police moved through the house room by room Paul Monk was on the UK's most wanted list on suspicion of drug trafficking Brennan, 25, from Liverpool, vanished in the resort of Javea in January last year after being kidnapped by men posing as police. His body was wrapped in an industrial-size bin bag with duct tape round it when it appeared on a beach in nearby Orihuela Costa. Civil Guard officers in Alicante confirmed today they believe Monk, from Essex, may be implicated in the violent death and named him as an associate of Paul Scott. Scott, 32, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine after being caught trying to sneak into Britain in a light aircraft last December. He was also wanted for questioning over Mr Brennan's murder when he was detained. Guardia Civil described him last night as the suspected mastermind of the crime. Monk was detained at a four-bedroom property in Javea near Alicante as he directed workers laying a marble patio around his swimming pool. An imitation firearm with a silencer and nearly \u00a3100,000 in cash were also found. He is being held in jail and is expected to be charged and face trial in Spain over Mr Brennan's murder before being extradited to the UK to face questioning over alleged drugs offences. He has been linked to the handover of one kilo of cocaine in Cockfosters, London, in May 2013 and the seizure of 24 kilos of cannabis in Colchester in October 2013. A Civil Guard spokesman said: 'He never left his house as a security measure to avoid being arrested. 'He got other people to bring him food and other things in the villa where he hid out, leading the life of an authentic fugitive.'  The police raid had air support, with this grab coming from footage of Monk's villa taken by a helicopter Wads of money found by armed police after they arrested Monk  Monk is being held in jail and is expected to be charged and face trial in Spain over Mr Brennan's murder before being extradited to the UK to face questioning over alleged drugs offences Spanish police search Monk's property thoroughly for evidence, finding an imitation gun with a silencer National Crime Agency detectives took part in the raid on the property along with Civil Guard officers. Mr Brennan, from Liverpool, was himself on the run after leaving Britain while awaiting sentence in the UK over the wounding of a man at a Swedish House Mafia music concert in Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire. He travelled to the Costa del Sol with his girlfriend towards the end of 2013 after ignoring the advice of his parents to stay in Britain. Police swooped on Scott last year after he flew from Holland to a remote airstrip in Norfolk. He had fake Belgian identity documents on him and more than \u00a31,500 in cash. He was jailed in January for plotting to import 40 tonnes of cocaine into Britain. Police described him as the 'last man outstanding in a criminal gang that plotted to smuggle vast quantities of cocaine into the UK' after he was sentenced to 14 years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court.

Marcin Wasniewski, 34, from Foleshill, Coventry, escaped death by millimetres after the car he was driving crashed into the back of a lorry on the A444 in Coventry. At the time, emergency services workers greeted by the twisted metal and scattered debris at the scene said it was incredible the driver was even alive. Merge: An ambulance spokeswoman said the car 'literally embedded' itself into the back of the lorry Father Marcin Wasniewski is volunteering at a Christian centre until he can return to work when he has recovered from his injuries. He believes he was saved by Jesus Christ watching over him Paramedics saw the scene and feared the worst. Ambulance staff and firefighters were working to release him and were shocked to see the driver emerge from the wreckage and walk away unaided Yet as paramedics and firefighters worked to release him, they were shocked to see him emerge from the wreckage and walk away unaided. Since then, paramedics have said the crash would certainly have been fatal if the impact had been just a couple of inches closer to the driver.   Now the dad-of-one has said he believes someone was watching over him that day. 'It was not luck. It was definitely Jesus Christ, son of God, that saved me,' he said. Marcin suffered a serious injury to the left side of his face, which has left him with a deep scar, and injured his left arm. He's currently unable to work because of his injuries but he is volunteering for the Christ Celebration Centre in Lockhurst Lane, Foleshill, while he recovers. He also spoke of what he remembers about the night that nearly claimed his life. Father of one Mr Wasniewski said: 'Before the accident I remember everything. I can remember driving along. 'I don't remember the accident though - when the crash happened everything just went blank. 'The next thing I remembered was waking up in hospital. I left hospital after five days.' Road to recovery: There's barely a scratch on Marcin Wasniewski who walked away from the dramatic crash scenes, picture below, after driving into the back of a lorry on the A444 in Coventry Twisted metal: Paramedics say that the outcome would've 'certainly been fatal' if the impact had been just a couple of inches closer to the driver's side or if a passenger had been in the car After the crash on March 8, it was reported how ambulance staff were stunned that Marcin had escaped life-threatening injuries. A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman had described how thetrailer had 'literally embedded' itself into the windscreen of the car. She added that while paramedics and firefighters worked to release him, the driver 'got out of the badly damaged car unaided'. She said: 'Whilst being assessed in the back of the ambulance, paramedics discovered that he had escaped the serious injuries often expected in such a significant collision. 'The paramedic area support officer commented that, if the impact had have been a couple of inches further across into the driver's side or if there had been a passenger in the car, the outcome would've certainly been fatal.'",

The mini-Martha Stewart, who is known simply as Charli, has turned her popular channel, CharlisCraftyKitchen into YouTube's largest food channel in less than three years - beating household names such as celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to claim the prestigious \u2013 and lucrative \u2013 title. According to data compiled by online video advertising company Outrigger Media, Charli's channel earned the young entrepreneur an estimated $127,777 (AUD $163,893) in March alone \u2013 and that is after YouTube's share of the profits.  Scroll down for video   Mini-Martha: Charli, an eight-year-old from Australia (pictured), makes an estimated $127,000 (AUD $162,472) per month from the ad revenue generated from her popular YouTube channel CharlisCraftyKitchen In comparison, Mr Oliver only earned an estimated $32,261 (AUD $41,347) in ad revenue from his channel's 6.9 million views last month.  Meanwhile, Charli and her five-year-old sister Ashlee, who serves as the channel's 'chief taste tester', are raking in an average of 29 million views per month for their crafty how-to videos.  CharlisCraftyKitchen, which features child friendly tutorials for making everything from Minnie Mouse pops out of Oreos to princess teacup cookies, also has more than 320,000 subscribers who eagerly await their weekly posts.  The tutorials even have their own short opening credits featuring Charli and Ashlee's cartoon likenesses, with one of the girl's singing: 'Welcome to Charli's Crafty Kitchen where you can eat what you make'.  Big numbers: Charli and her five-year-old sister Ashlee's how to video on making Frozen-inspired ice pops has earned 57 million views since it was posted last July Being silly: The sisters made a mess while eating their 'shark' Jello cups Many of clips are inspired by the holidays, with a demonstration on how to make a Kit Kat Christmas cake receiving more than two million views since it was posted in December.  One particular video featuring a simple recipe for 'rainbow' donuts has been watched more than 6.5 million times after it was shared in 2014. But that's nothing. A video which sees the dynamic duo creating Jello 'tip' ice pops inspired-by the hit Disney film Frozen has amassed an incredible 57 million views since it was posted last June. Charli earned another million views after she advertised the clip on her Facebook page yesterday, writing: '56 million YouTube views must mean these \u202a#\u200eFrozen inspired popsicles are REALLY tasty! [sic]'  Disney kids: Charli and Ashlee used icing and M&M's to make Cinderella brownie jar treats  'My [two]-year-old loves watching this video and we make them all the time. They are a huge hit in our household. Thank you,' one mom commented, while another joked: 'My five-year-old might account for a few hundred of [the views].' Charli started CharlisCraftyKitchen in 2012 when she was only six-years-old according to her channel's description, which notes that she 'has always been passionate about her craft and being in front of a camera'.  But Chali isn't the only kid making big money off of beloved YouTube videos.    Mark and Rhea, the parents behind the popular YouTube channel Hulyan Maya, are expected to earn $1.5 million dollars from ad revenue in 2015 alone from their videos of their three children playing with toys.   Looks good: Charli can be seen putting the final touches on a Minnie Mouse pop made out an Oreo cookie Made with love: The girls end every video by trying their delicious treats",

      "src": "On the surface, the mix-up seems incomprehensible: How can a volunteer sheriff's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a Taser, killing a man? That's apparently what happened in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when a 73-year-old reserve deputy, Robert Bates, killed Eric Harris. Bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead. \"Oh! I shot him. I'm sorry,\" Bates said in a video of the shooting. But it's happened before. In a well-publicized 2009 case, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fired his gun instead of his Taser, killing 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland, California. The former officer, Johannes Mehserle, testified that he had meant to use his Taser but drew his gun instead. Mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct. So how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a Taser? Here are some factors to consider: Law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body, and the Taser should be placed on the nondominant side. So if an officer is left-handed, the gun should be on the left side. Bates' attorney said his client is left-handed. But the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side. \"I shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed,\" Bates said in a written statement to investigators. After Bates announced at the scene he was going to use his Taser, he \"used his nondominant hand, and it was the gun,\" said Clark Brewster, Bates' attorney. \"He said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder, assumed it was the Taser,\" Brewster said. \"Both the gun and the Taser have a laser sight, and he just made a mistake.\" Brewster also said his client's left hand was holding a pepper gun. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had grabbed a \"pepper ball launcher\" to try to slow or stop Harris, who was running away. Bates did not say explicitly where the Taser was on his body. But he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was \"startled\" by the recoil of the gun. \"After realizing what had happened I was in a state of shock and disbelief,\" he told investigators. Bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter. If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison. Deputy who shot Eric Harris turns himself in Bates was carrying his personal gun, a Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolver, and a Model X26 Taser, he said in his statement to investigators. Attorneys representing the Harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices. One held up a small black .357 revolver, followed by a mostly bright yellow Taser that was noticeably larger than the gun. \"There's no way an officer can get this confused with this,\" said one of the attorneys from the law firm of Smolen, Smolen & Roytman. Taser's X26 model comes in different designs. Some are mostly yellow, while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle. But all appear to be larger than Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolvers. Sgt. Jim Clark of the Tulsa Police Department -- which is separate from the county sheriff's office for which Bates volunteered -- said Bates was the \"victim\" of something called \"slip and capture.\" That's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation. But a criminal justice expert told CNN the claim amounts to \"junk science.\" \"There's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this. ... It's not generally accepted by the scientific community,\" said Phil Stinson, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University. \"So it's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence.\" An attorney for the Harris family said the \"slip and capture\" theory hasn't held up in court. \"The only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in Oakland (of Oscar Grant),\" the attorney said. And that defense failed. Tasers are built to feel and look different than guns, according to Taser International. Steve Tuttle, vice president for strategic communications at Taser, noted some of those differences to CNN: A gun is heavier. A Taser has a different grip and feel. When you take the safety off on a Taser, an LED control panel lights up. There's more: Tasers can be different colors (yellow or black), and the holster is different from a gun's. But in the field, where an officer reacts on instinct, there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important, Tuttle said. Taser's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer's nondominant side, as law enforcement experts say. And its training suggests that officers shout aloud, \"Taser! Taser! Taser!\" as they prepare to deploy it. These guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for. It is up to each law enforcement department, however, in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body. The company declined to comment on the Tulsa shooting in particular. The stun guns, or conducted electrical weapons, manufactured by Taser have been used more than 2.7 million times, Tuttle said, and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death.

The struggling Barclays Premier League champions know they need more English players in their starting line-up \u2014 goalkeeper Joe Hart has often been the only one this season \u2014 and Liverpool's Henderson and Arsenal's Wilshere are deemed to be realistic targets. City also maintain an interest in Liverpool's unsettled England forward Raheem Sterling, with 36-year-old veteran Frank Lampard set to leave and 29-year-old James Milner likely to follow him out of the Etihad Stadium. England midfielder Jack Wilshere (right) is a surprise target on Manchester City's summer shopping list Wilshere tries to cut inside during his appearance for Arsenal's Under 21 side on Tuesday night Liverpool's Jordan Henderson is another surprise name among targets of Manchester City for this summer Manchester City also maintain an interest in Liverpool's unsettled forward Raheem Sterling Henderson, 24, has come to City's attention because he has only one year left on his Liverpool contract. Their concern about Wilshere, 23, who has over two years left on his Arsenal deal, is his injury record. He has yet to return to Arsene Wenger's side since having surgery on his troublesome left ankle in November. There is a well-trodden path between Arsenal and City over the past five years.  The Manchester club, who offer far bigger salaries, have spent \u00a380million on Samir Nasri, Bacary Sagna, Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy. Frank Lampard was among the few English representatives for Manchester City at Selhurst Park Joe Hart (centre) was the only England player that started while James Milner (right) came on as a sub Wilshere played 90 minutes for Arsenal as he stepped up in his return from injury at the Emirates Henderson clears the ball during Liverpool's defeat by Arsenal at the Emirates in the Premier League And City will certainly need to make bids in excess of \u00a330m to tempt Arsenal or Liverpool to sell. Not all of City's targets will be English, though, with the club willing to use France star Nasri and Bosnia forward Edin Dzeko as bait in a deal to sign Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. Pogba, a 22-year-old France international, was on Manchester United's books before moving to Italy. City see him as the long-term successor to the fading Yaya Toure, although Pogba could cost as much as \u00a360m. Nasri and Dzeko have had poor seasons and are expected to be part of a summer cull.  Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is another target of those at the Etihad for this summer's transfer market Pogba, a 22-year-old France international, was on Manchester United's books before leaving for Italy",

Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy. Batschelet warns that current trends mean as many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Scroll down for video  As many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy 'The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,' he told CNN. 'We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50 percent, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army. It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.' Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country in 2014, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, too many tattoos or a lack of education - but 10 percent didn't qualify because they were overweight.  According to the CDC, 81 percent of overweight boys and 71 percent of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. Army recruiters, facing overweight prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up, have become fitness coaches - much like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser. Boot camp: The maximum body fat percentage that the army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females The recruiters will spend time educating the hopefuls on diet and exercise and encourage them to lose the pounds necessary to qualify for boot camp.  Many still fail to make the grade, but some do - such as a female recruit from Kansas who lost 80 pounds in a year so that she could sign up. 'We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,' said Batschelet. 'We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.' The maximum body fat percentage that the Army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females.   The maximum a female soldier, aged 17-20, can weigh is 227 pounds, while the maximum for a male soldier in the same age group is 234 pounds and in both instances that is dependent on being 80 inches tall. Obesity rates have tripled in a generation with more than one-third of U.S. adults now considered obese, while 17 percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese.  Army recruiters are having to act like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser (ex-trainer Jillian Michaels pictured above) when they met prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up but are too fat to fight",

Blackburn face a dilemma this summer as they contend with Financial Fairplay restrictions with Middlesbrough, Derby and Nottingham Forest ready to bid for Jordan Rhodes too.  They want to gain promotion but need to sell to balance the books. Swansea are also keen to sign a left-back with Leicester's Jeffrey Schlupp among the players being considered.

      "src": "Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is unsure whether a planned boycott by Newcastle fans will prove a help or hindrance to his side this weekend. This season, like so many in recent years, has been a frustrating one at St James' Park and that has led some fans to take action when Spurs arrive on Sunday. A number of supporters plan to boycott the televised game in protest against owner Mike Ashley, which is likely to lead to a peculiar atmosphere in the north east. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino (right) is in an upbeat mood ahead of the trip to Newcastle Newcastle fans are staging a mass protest against the current regime at St James' Park It will certainly make it an interesting test for Pochettino's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own. 'You never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive,' the Spurs boss said. 'Maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season. 'Or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and don't show their face. 'You never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team. For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday.' On paper, this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa. Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs' season in danger of fizzling out The fact Pochettino's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter's victory made it all the more frustrating, yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James' Park. 'I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player, manager and head coach,' he said. 'I accept in football there are good and bad moments, but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood. 'We always want to win and we are ambitious, but always we need to have a very good mood. 'We need to have patience, we need to work hard, we have to have our minds on the players and we need to have very good energy to repeat some of the performances this season.' Pochettino will come up against his countryman Jonas Guiterrez following his recovery from cancer This weekend's match against Newcastle will also see Pochettino come up against a countryman who has made many a headline of late. Former Argentina international Jonas Gutierrez's recovery following a battle with cancer and his return to top-flight football has inspired many. 'I am very happy for him,' Pochettino said. 'When he went in the game against Liverpool, he got a good ovation and it was good to see him playing football. 'This is real life. Sometimes we worry about a lot of things and results, but this is real life when you have the problems that he has. 'For me, I am very happy to see him come back to football.'",

Damon Clay, 17, is in a medically induced coma in critical condition at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta after Monday's attack. Officers have arrested 19-year-old Quintavious Barber and 18-year-old Malik Morton for aggravated assault and cruelty to a child, among other charges. Damon Clay, 17, was left with burns covering 70 per cent of his body after two other teens attacked him with a pot of boiling rice while he was sleeping. He is now in a medically induced coma in critical condition Relatives of the scalded victim said the two men accused him of stealing a PlayStation 3. Neighbors say the three teens were friends. 'They were friends. Everybody was supposed to be friends,' neighbor Laprell Grant told WSBTV. Kentaveus Watson, who is renting the apartment where the incident happened, said that he is friends with everyone who was involved in the attack and he's still shocked by the events that occurred.   'It scared me, really. Ever since it happened, I've been sleeping on the couch right where he got burned,' he said. Clay had been in jail for a burglary and was just released on a three-month program offered by a nonprofit in the area.  Relatives of Clay (pictured) said that the two men who have been arrested for attacking him - 19-year-old Quintavious Barber and 18-year-old Malik Morton - accused Clay of stealing a PlayStation 3. Neighbors said the three men were friends He was promised shelter and guidance by a minister in the program, but family members who did not want to be named said that that was not the case.  'He didn't have any supervision, none,' Clay's aunt told WSBTV.  Clay did not go to a group home for shelter, but rather bounced from home to home of relatives and friends who were willing to take him in, family members said.  'I'd rather my nephew be in jail than to be here,' the aunt told WSBTV.    Clay had been released from jail shortly before the incident and was bouncing from friends' and relatives' houses  to sleep.

Facinet Keita, 31, fled the Olympic village in summer 2012, claiming his failure to win a medal meant he 'would be murdered' if he returned to his native Guinea. His wife who was left to look after the couple's two children has now split from him because she 'couldn't wait for him'. Mr Keita \u2013 the official flag-bearer for the West African nation during the opening ceremony \u2013 said he decided to go on the run after losing to an opponent from the Pacific island of Guam within five minutes.  He said: 'My coaches told me I had lost the fight like a baby. They said I embarrassed my country and I would be in big trouble when we are at home.' After three months sleeping rough, Mr Keita handed himself in to authorities and was locked up in an immigration detention centre. While there he made two requests for asylum, both of which were rejected. After the second failed request, he was told he had to leave Britain on December 17, 2013. He agreed to board a plane to Ghana, but upon arrival there he said that he was turned back because he did not have the correct travel documents. He returned to Britain and was once again detained.  However, he was released in March 2014 and has since been coaching judo in Stoke-on-Trent. He now plans to make a third application for asylum. Mr Keita said he has built a new life in Britain and has met friends who have become like family. 'The people here are really welcoming, if you show them you are a good person,' he added. Mr Keita was one of 20 Olympians who remained in Britain after the Games.  He is refusing to leave the UK after he lost by ippon in the qualifying stages of the Men's +100kg against 34-stone Ricardo Blas Junior, from Guam (right) Keita claims his coaches told him he lost the fight 'like a baby' and there would be trouble when he returned He is now being supported by an asylum seeker charity in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, while he applies for his third asylum application, after his first two bids and an appeal were refused He is volunteering at a Sneyd Green Primary School Judo Club in Stoke (pictured) because he cannot earn a living pending his asylum application Before travelling to the UK for the Olympics, he had won five national titles in Guinea and regularly appeared on TV. Mr Keita denies he has stayed in Britain to claim benefits. He said: 'My situation is difficult, 100 per cent difficult. I want to be near my family and I want to see them but I can't.' His request to stay in Britain has been backed by the African Social Health Agency, which supports asylum seekers. It described Mr Keita as an asset to the local community. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We do not routinely comment on individual cases. 'The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and we consider every claim on its individual merits. 'When someone is found not to need our protection, we expect them to leave the country.'",

      "src": "Not only does Gareth Bale definitely want to stay at Real Madrid beyond the end of this season but he is determined to win over some of the hardest to please supporters in football and become the best player in the world.  Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become. Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid.  Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United Bale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters Bale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final He said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.' Real Madrid's \u00a386million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify.  His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season. Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side. Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes The possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid. In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid. He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time. Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey The former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season He wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps. At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest. In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate. Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend.  Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas De Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea De Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain. He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2. Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable. De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for \u00a318million All that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real. The supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain. But they don't believe it will be necessary. They see both men lining-up for them next season. Bale's desire to stay in Spain will keep him at Madrid. It only remains to be seen just how much De Gea wants to join him in the Spanish capital.",

      "src": "The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is one of the icons of the Cold War - a self-contained and sufficient town buried under the Rockies meant to be impervious to a Soviet nuclear barrage. It was home to the North American Aerospace Command (NORAD), scanning the skies for Russian missiles and the military command and control center of the United States in the event of World War Three. The high tech base entered popular culture with appearances in the 1983 Cold War thriller War Games and 1994's Stargate - which imagined the complex as a clandestine home for intergalactic travel. Scroll down for video  Secret: The Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado was built for NORAD to direct the American response to a nuclear war with the USSR during the Cold War Protection: There are 15 three story building inside the military complex and each is buffered by a 25-ton blast door Small town: The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is home to more than 1,000 personnel and is able to operate as an underground town for months with fresh water and food It shut down nearly ten years ago as the threat from Russia seemed to subside, but this week the Pentagon announced that Cheyenne Mountain will once again be home to the most advanced tracking and communications equipment in the United States military. The shift to the Cheyenne Mountain base in Colorado is designed to safeguard the command's sensitive sensors and servers from a potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, military officers said. The Pentagon last week announced a $700 million contract with Raytheon Corporation to oversee the work for North American Aerospace Command (NORAD) and US Northern Command. Admiral William Gortney, head of NORAD and Northern Command, said that 'because of the very nature of the way that Cheyenne Mountain's built, it's EMP-hardened.' Power: At its height Cheyenne was home to NORAD who watched 7,000 aircraft per day as part of their surveillance operations Headquarters: The US and Canadian military jointly operated NORAD from within Cheyenne and soldiers from north of the border made up 15 percent of the personnel at the base Around-the-clock crews monitor U.S. skies from the command center of the Northern Command  located deep within Cheyenne Mountain at the foot of the Rocky Mountains near Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2002 'And so, there's a lot of movement to put capability into Cheyenne Mountain and to be able to communicate in there,' Gortney told reporters. 'My primary concern was... are we going to have the space inside the mountain for everybody who wants to move in there, and I'm not at liberty to discuss who's moving in there,' he said. The Cheyenne mountain bunker is a half-acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack. From inside the massive complex, airmen were poised to send warnings that could trigger the launch of nuclear missiles. But in 2006, officials decided to move the headquarters of NORAD and US Northern Command from Cheyenne to Petersen Air Force base in Colorado Springs. The Cheyenne bunker was designated as an alternative command center if needed. Almost 10 years ago, the military closed the secretive defense complex carved into Cheyenne Mountain that for decades monitored American skies for threats. The North American Aerospace Defense Command operations center was moved to nearby Peterson Air Force Base, which is home to the U.S. Northern Command created after the Sept. 11 attacks. Cheyenne Mountain Complex is 2,000 feet below the granite rocks and made up of 15 three-story buildings protected from nuclear blasts and seismic movement by a system of 1,000 giant springs. The entire complex is designed to withstand a direct hit by a 30 megaton nuclear explosion and has 25-ton blast doors surrounding the complex. NORAD, a joint U.S. and Canadian command, was set up in the 1960s to monitor the skies for threats like missiles, aircraft and space objects. In 2006, Adm. Tim Keating, who commanded both NORAD and the U.S. Northern Command, said the government's best intelligence 'led them to believe a missile attack from China or Russia was very unlikely.' Cold War heroes: The Cheyenne mountain bunker is a half-acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack That, along with the emergence of varied terrorist threats such as suicide bombers, 'was why we recommended that we don't need to maintain Cheyenne Mountain in a 24/7 status. We can put it on `warm standby,' said Keating. About 1,100 people work in the mountain, long a symbol of the Cold War. Buildings inside it are mounted on springs to absorb the shock from a nuclear blast, while the entrance is guarded by a vault-like door several feet thick. The complex includes banks of batteries and its own water supply. Excavation on the site began in 1961. Canadian crews stationed at Cheyenne Mountain will also made the move to Peterson, Keating said. Hollywood: Sci-fi movie Stargate (1994) was set inside the Cheyenne Mountain Complex while 1983's War Games also imagine a nuclear standoff operated from inside the nuclear bunker That move was touted a more efficient use of resources but had followed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of modernization work at Cheyenne carried out after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Now the Pentagon is looking at shifting communications gear to the Cheyenne bunker, officials said. 'A lot of the back office communications is being moved there,' said one defense official. Officials said the military's dependence on computer networks and digital communications makes it much more vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse, which can occur naturally or result from a high-altitude nuclear explosion. Under the 10-year contract, Raytheon is supposed to deliver 'sustainment' services to help the military perform 'accurate, timely and unambiguous warning and attack assessment of air, missile and space threats' at the Cheyenne and Petersen bases. Raytheon's contract also involves unspecified work at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.",

Spanish artist Catalina Viejo, 31, who is based in New York, paints miniature pictures from candid paparazzi shots rather than using glossy magazine images, and has worked her magic on stars including Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9. In total she has completed 42 tiny pictures, which are the size of a postage stamp and don't feature any faces, and cost around $90 (\u00a360). Scroll down for video   Artist Catalina Viejo paints miniature pictures of famous bottoms, including Kim Kardashian's, from candid paparazzi shots Amber Rose is Catalina's favourite portrait of the 42 miniatures, as hers was the biggest bottom on the smallest canvas The bite-sized series is aptly titled 'A View of the End' and is currently on display at the SHAG Gallery in Brooklyn, New York. Catalina explained that she wanted to paint her celebrity subjects while they were relaxed or on holiday - not as they are seen in glamorous campaigns which have been polished and airbrushed. In keeping with this approach, Catalina named each work with just the celebrity's first name, making each piece more personal. Miley Cyrus: In total, the 31-year-old artist has completed 42 miniature works, which cost up to $90 (\u00a360) each Cameron Diaz: The bite-sized series is titled 'A View of the End' and is currently on display at the SHAG Gallery in Brooklyn, New York Katy Perry: Catalina explains that she wanted to paint her celebrity subjects while they were relaxed or on holiday - not as they are seen in glamorous campaigns As well as the current exhibit, 30 of the artist's works are also available in a book under the same title. Speaking about the series, Catalina said: 'The fact these butts belong to celebrities increases the viewer's curiosity. 'Partly because you feel as if you're looking at intimate images of people you're familiar with, but also because of the contradiction created in the context of celebrity.   Britney Spears: Catalina named each work with just the celebrity's first name, making each piece more personal Penelope Cruz: As well as the current exhibit, 30 of the artist's works are also available in a book under the same title Gisele Bundchen with her baby: Speaking about the series, Catalina said, 'The fact these butts belong to celebrities increases the viewer's curiosity. Partly because you feel as if you're looking at intimate images of people you're familiar with.' Catalina added: 'The most powerful marketing tool a celebrity has is his or her public identity, and the face represents that identity. 'Even when we see a famous rear in a magazine, it's accompanied by the celebrity's face. 'My miniature paintings include no faces and some would be very difficult to recognise without the title forcing people to become their own paparazzi. 'People tell me they feel as though they are looking literally at the 'back of fame' which is fun to think about. 'I enjoyed painting each one for different reasons, but I really liked painting Amber's bum (one of the largest bums) at the smallest scale. The painting of her bum is the smallest in the exhibition, about the size of my thumbnail!'

      "src": "David Crossley developed large kidney stones Like many busy people, David Crossley often used to find himself so wrapped up in his working day that he would go without lunch, and often barely stopped for a cup of tea. In fact, David, 63, a musculoskeletal therapist from Birmingham, admits: 'I would often be so busy at the clinic that I'd forget to drink any liquid at all, other than the odd cup of tea or coffee. It had been the same way for years - although I would drink more water at weekends.' Last year, this habit caught up with him. He noticed a vague ache in his abdomen, stretching around to his back. 'It wasn't agonising but it just didn't feel quite right, so I went to the GP,' he says. 'As I had some bloating, he sent me for an ultrasound.' This revealed two large stones in his right kidney - a direct result, his doctors believe, of his low fluid intake. A CT scan showed that the stones were so large (6 mm across) they could not be passed naturally, and he needed surgery. One in ten of us will develop a kidney stone, and the numbers are rising dramatically. They are the result of waste products in the blood forming crystals inside the kidneys, which eventually build up into a solid lump. They can be excruciatingly painful - on a level, say experts, with childbirth. The stones often remain symptomless while they're in the kidney. They start causing pain - known as renal colic - once they travel down the ureter, the narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. 'Renal colic is caused by the stone suddenly blocking the ureter,' says Mr Leye Ajayi, consultant urological surgeon at the Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth, London. The pain often comes on suddenly and can cause the patient to 'writhe around in agony', he adds. The pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomiting. Once on the move, a stone can take days or weeks to travel out of the body. In that time, it may cause persistent or intermittent pain in the back, groin or side, a need to urinate more than usual, and pain when urinating. Sometimes, if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney, it can lead to a build-up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection. Signs of this include a fever, shivering, extreme weakness, diarrhoea, or cloudy and bad-smelling urine. The bad news is that the number of people developing troublesome stones is rocketing. Emergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent, according to official figures, rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year. Meanwhile, the number of people going in for planned non-emergency treatment for stones has almost doubled in the same period, rising from 26,666 in 2004 to 51,340.  The cause for his condition, doctors believe, was low fluid intake And bizarrely, it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym, and then not drinking enough, or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame, and may be why cases are going up, especially among women. 'More men than women used to suffer from kidney stones, with a ratio of about three to one,' says Mr Ajayi. 'But an increasing number of women now get them, and the ratio is evening up.' The main cause of kidney stones is dehydration. 'Your kidneys are your waste-disposal system,' explains Dr Kathryn Griffith, the Royal College of GPs' clinical champion for kidney care. 'They discard all the waste chemicals produced by your body, and they can do this efficiently if enough liquid is drunk to help flush them through. 'But if you become dehydrated, you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone-forming chemicals, and these begin to bind together to build stones.' To avoid this, you need to drink enough to ensure your urine is 'the colour of white wine', says Dr Griffith - around 1.2 litres a day. You need more during hot weather or after exercise. Changing diet trends are also pushing the figures up. 'There has been a trend, especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle, to eat low-carb, high-protein diets,' says Dr Griffith. 'The animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid (a known stone-former) in your urine. They also reduce the amount of citrate (a stone-inhibitor). 'This can lead to uric acid stones forming, especially if you also don't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job.' There are other causes, too. Your kidneys remove sodium, which is the main component of salt, from your body. When they do this, they excrete calcium, too. But low-carb diets could also put you at risk So the more salt you eat, the more calcium you will have in your urine, which can build into stones. Obesity is another risk factor. 'Obese people are more likely to have insulin resistance (where the body can't use insulin effectively),' says Mr Ajayi. This causes a change to the nature of urine, making it more acidic, which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney. Eating excessive amounts of oxalate is another culprit, as it can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones - the most common kind. Oxalate-rich foods include tea, spinach, rhubarb, nuts, strawberries, beetroot and chocolate. They are all fine in moderation, but avoid large daily quantities. If you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time, you should ask your GP for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones, which are caused by a build-up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections, adds Dr Griffith. Virtually all stones under 5 mm in diameter can be passed naturally, with only prescription-strength pain relief and medication that relaxes the ureter needed while this happens, says Mr Ajayi. But if a stone is bigger, you may need to have treatment. The most common is extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This involves sending shock-waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone. 'This works for stones up to about 10 mm in diameter, but not for bigger ones, or for stones that are very hard,' says Mr Ajayi. 'It's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity, as the shock-waves have further to go to reach the stone.' For bigger or harder stones, a ureteroscopy is performed. Under general anaesthetic, a thin scope is passed up your urethra and a laser is used to break up the stone. For very large stones (those over 15 mm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is used. A nephroscope - a telescope-like device - is inserted through a small incision in your back. The stone is broken up using a combination of high-frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy (a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road). David Crossley had a ureteroscopy at the BMI Priory Hospital, Birmingham, in September. 'I was out the day after my surgery, and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days, thankfully I'm now stone-free.' He knows that a person who has had a stone has a 50 per cent chance of developing them again within five years unless they make changes to their lifestyle. 'The lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place: proper hydration, low-salt, staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein,' says Mr Ajayi. The British Association of Urological Surgeons advises that we should be aiming for no more than four of the following protein portions a day, two of which should be dairy to ensure you have enough calcium: 50-75 g of red meat, chicken or fish; two eggs; \u00bd pint of milk; 50g cheese; a small pot of yogurt. Mr Ajayi also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily, as the citrate (a form of acetic acid) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances, such as oxalates, that lead to stones. Today, David ensures that he gets enough fluid. 'I didn't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones,' he says. 'I now drink water religiously!'",

      "src": "A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by \u00a3345 to \u00a3975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from \u00a3870 to \u00a31,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from \u00a3870 to \u00a31,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay \u00a3345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost \u00a3975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.",

      "src": "Easter is here! And whilst many Australians are enjoying an abundance of sugary treats, many are wondering how much it's going to cost them around the waistline. According to the ABC, the key is to maintain an even balance of 'energy in' and 'energy out.'   This means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight.  A small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work off Indulging in two hot cross buns (without jam and butter) will take up to 50 minutes of running to work off It may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of Easter treats.  For four solid mini chocolate Easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules.  A female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes, whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes.  One medium chocolate bunny takes two and a half to three hours of kayaking with women needing to paddle for half an hour longer than men to work it off. The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out' and balancing food and fitness Experts are advising that it is better to manage our energy consumption than to try and work it off afterward Two hot cross buns takes up to 50 minutes running and if you have lathered it with butter and jam, it would take 80 minutes of running. Exercise physiologist Alex Lawrence from Exercise Sport Science Australia has said that many Australians still struggle to maintain a healthy weight as most do not realise how many kilojoules are in the foods we consume. 'It's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption, than to try and work off the energy after you've taken it in,' he said. Lawrence is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat. He advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eating part of your lifestyle so that you can indulge in treats every now and then. 'What we're trying to encourage people to do is make better lifestyle choices; to eat treat foods in moderation and to make sure they are physically active most of the time. That way when holidays, like Easter, come around they don't have to feel like they have to deny themselves,' he said.",

The 18-year-old reportedly fled to the toilet in tears and afterwards told police that the \u00a355,000-a-week Tottenham winger had left her with a bruise below her eye. The 28-year-old, who is on loan to Everton, was reportedly interviewed by officers under caution over the alleged assault earlier this month. A teenage waitress claims England footballer Aaron Lennon (pictured playing for Everton) grabbed her, slapped her and ripped her top  After taking part in Everton's 1-0 win at home against Southampton on April 4, Lennon is thought to have headed to Suede nightclub in Manchester with friends.  Lennon, who has 21 England caps, lives in a penthouse apartment in the city centre.  That night, the venue, which is popular with Premier League footballers, was packed with hundreds who had come to see singer Trey Songz perform. But later in the evening, the waitress claimed to have been attacked by the player in the VIP section - where booths cost \u00a32,000. She was interviewed by Greater Manchester Police four days later.  A source told The Sun's Michael Hamilton and Dean Wilkins that the girl, who is 'very pretty', had worked at the club for just under a year. He added that the footballer and his friends were 'spending a lot of money on drinks'.  Police are investigating the alleged incident at Suede nightclub (pictured) in Manchester which is popular with Premier League stars. On the night of April 4, singer Trey Songz (right) performed at the venue  'She got really upset, left what she was doing and rushed to the toilet,' the source said. 'She came out about an hour later and was annoyed security had not done anything and kicked Lennon out.  'She says he grabbed her and ripped her top and then slapped her.'  On April 15, the day before Lennon's 28th birthday, he was interviewed by police officers on suspicion of assault. Police confirmed no arrests were made and an investigation is ongoing.  A Greater Manchester Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'On Wednesday 8 April 2015, police were called following reports an 18-year old woman had been assaulted at Suede night club, Longworth Street, Manchester city centre on Sunday 5 April 2015. 'A man has been interviewed under caution. No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.' MailOnline has contacted Mr Lennon's agent and club for comment.",

The city known for excess of everything -- drinking, eating, dancing in the street until all hours -- went smoke-free as Tuesday became Wednesday at midnight. How can that be? It turns out that the city known for its over-the-top Mardi Gras celebrations and incredible jazz fests (starting Friday!) didn't want its waiters and musicians to have to breathe smoke to do their jobs anymore. The New Orleans City Council passed its ban against smoking in most places across the city -- including bars, casinos and restaurants -- in January, and the vote was unanimous, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reports. Bar owners worried about potential revenue loss, while puffing customers bemoaned the loss of their smoking spots. Harrah's New Orleans and bar owners filed a lawsuit to stop the ban, and a hearing is scheduled in state court in a month, CNN affiliate WAPT reports. Fines start at $50. Luckily for us, none of CNN's 15 New Orleans must-do's -- including touring Treme or eating a beignet -- requires smoking.",

Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man vs PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the third in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I look back on one of the most anticipated events of the 20th century which divided a nation.  THE SECOND FIGHT OF THE CENTURY Joe Frazier v Muhammad Ali Madison Square Garden, New York March 8, 1971 The Greatest had been stripped of the world heavyweight title he had won so sensationally against Sonny Liston but it was the reason for that decision which added cultural significance to what was to be a magnificent fight.  Sweat sprays off Muhammad Ali (right) as Joe Frazier collects his jaw with a strong left in 1971 Ali and Frazier at Madison Square Garden, New York, on March 8, 1971, was the second 'Fight of the Century' Ali's evasive abilities and speed, such as this swerve from a Frazier hook, kept him in the fight Smokin' Joe was the undefeated two-belt champion but it was this proud black man's bizarre adoption by America's conservative right which stoked the fires of society still further. Muhammad Ali had been banned from boxing for three-and-a-half years for refusing induction into the US military to fight in Vietnam \u2013 but as a consequence become the darling of the young, the black and the Civil Rights movement. Joe Frazier found himself unwittingly the standard bearer for the white establishment.  Ali fanned the flames by labelling the simpler man who would become his arch-rival an 'Uncle Tom,' the most wounding insult for an African American There was a foretaste of the current scramble for Mayweather-Pacquaio tickets. Woody Allen was one of the very few celebrities give a complimentary seat and other famous names had to work their way into the 20,000 crowd at the Garden. Frank Sinatra persuaded Life magazine to give him a camera and send him as their ringside photographer.  Fast-talking Ali offensively labelled Frazier an 'Uncle Tom' due to the support he got from white conservatives  Referee Tony Perez, widely believed to have acted leniently in Ali's favour, orders the pair to their corners JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York  Author Norman Mailer reported on the fight. Actor Burt Lancaster picked up a TV microphone for his only stint as a colour commentator. Artist Leroy Neiman sat at his easel painting Ali and Frazier as they fought. This was one fight in which the action fully lived up to the hype and its place in history. Ali came out fast to dominate the first three rounds. Frazier, encouraged by catching Ali with the last punch of the third, launched an attack to the body in the fourth which brought him into the ascendancy.  Ali's speed of hand, dancing feet and combination punching kept him in a fight in which he was taking increasing punishment \u2013 along with a little help from referee Arthur Mercante who declined to call a knock down when Frazier sent him crashing in the eighth.  Ali is laid out on the canvas as Frazier is send to the corner before a long 10-count in the 15th round  Somehow, heroically, survived the especially torrid 11th and 14th rounds. Still some good judges had it close going into the 15th and last round. There all argument was ended. Frazier caught him with the most wicked of all those trademark left hooks and this time there was no denying a count which appeared to edge a fraction longer than the stipulated ten seconds.  Ali rose to his feet. Unsteadily. His jaw grotesquely swollen. Again his courage carried him to the bell. The decision was unanimously in favour of Frazier, although both men went to hospital. Frazier got the unanimous decision from the judges but both men went to hospital after the epic bout Very late that night word spread through New York's animated bars that one of them had died. Frazier checked out early, quietly. Ali pronounced the rumours of his passing to be premature. Their trilogy was born. They were to fight twice more and on one of those occasions each would come close to death again.",

      "src": "Police are using tiny plastic Lego figures in a campaign to warn people about the rising tide of housebreakings in Scotland. Officers from Police Scotland's Edinburgh division \u2013 which has seen break-ins soar by nearly 40 per cent \u2013 posted pictures of the Lego models on their Facebook page as part of a move to raise awareness of crime. Last night, victims branded the move as 'insensitive' and 'a joke'.  Hands up: Plastic Lego figures are being used by police as part of a quirky campaign to warn people about the dangers of housebreaking. But the move received a backlash, with victims branding it as 'a joke' The police internet posting showed scenes of Lego criminals attempting to break into people's homes before being arrested by officers \u2013 and were accompanied by a Scots dialect poem giving advice. But the publicity stunt was met with criticism from politicians and victims who said officers should concentrate on solving real crimes. Break-ins in Edinburgh rose by 38.7 per cent in the 12 months to April 2014, with 4,101 homes hit. Across Scotland, housebreakings rose 4 per cent to 22,272 over the same period. The row will fuel concerns over the number of officers spending their days in police stations, rather than pounding the beat. Last year, critics claimed many officers were having to 'backfill' \u2013 being taken off beat duties to carry out office jobs previously covered by civilian workers. Be vigilant: The Lego figures are arranged into scenes with robbers and police officers to provide safety tips and highlight the importance of securing people's homes. Last night Police Scotland defended the campaign Last night, Police Scotland defended the campaign, pointing out that the photos have been viewed almost 350,000 times. But Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: 'With housebreaking on the increase, officers should be out solving real crimes, rather than relying on Lego to try and prevent it.' The pictures are part of an anti-housebreaking drive, Operation RAC. They were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling the city's housebreaking problem. One image shows a Lego figurine in a hat and standing beside a door. Another shows a man standing on a ledge with another figure below. Poems were posted alongside the pictures, with one reading: 'Staying in or goin oot? Lock the windaes 'n' front door. A simple step maybe, that'll prevent access tae them on the chore.' 'Keep yer hame safe when yer oot on the go, By usin' timers on lights 'n' even the radio, Timers are cheap 'n' it takes seconds tae do, And it cuid prevent ye fae calling the boys in blue.' 'Look how ye get access tae the back o' yer hame, If it's easy others wull dae the same, Restrict access tae the rear, And help prevent others fae choring yer gear.' One victim of housebreaking, Tamara Swanson from Newhaven, Edinburgh, was not impressed. The 20-year-old was alone in her home last July when an intruder attacked her as she was getting out of the shower. The man grabbed her from behind, punched her and then tried to strangle her before she managed to escape. Speaking last night, she said police had done little to help her since the incident. 'We had to keep phoning them [Police Scotland],' she said. 'I'm still going to a psychiatrist and they're putting a lot of anxiety down to this. I wasn't sleeping for months. I didn't feel safe at all.' Speaking about the online campaign, she said: 'They're [people online] not going to look at it and think, \"That's interesting\" and do anything about it.' Her father, Peter Swanson, added: 'Why would they bother doing that? Lego? It's a joke. Police Scotland is a waste of time. 'It's a money-saving thing, obviously to the detriment of policing. The cartoons are stupid. Get the guys back on the street.' Another housebreaking victim, Michael Wright said the pictures were 'terrible' and 'insensitive'. His house in the Inch area of Edinburgh was broken into just before Christmas, with thieves taking money he had set aside for presents, as well as his Ford Fiesta. Mr Wright, whose young son was at home sleeping at the time of the incident, said: 'Could they not have used the resources elsewhere, rather than reconstructing scenes of burglaries with Lego sets? 'When I saw that, I thought it was just insensitive to the victims of burglaries. They have nothing better to be doing than sitting behind their computer on Facebook.' Watch out: The campaign was shared on social media with fun poems. Pictures were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling Edinburgh's housebreaking problem He added: 'Most of the people who are being targeted are older folks in their 80s. They don't have Facebook or social media, so how are they supposed to get the message?' Chief Supt Mark Williams, Edinburgh divisional commander, said: 'Over 354,000 people have already seen this campaign on social media giving us significant reach for crime prevention messages. 'Social media is an important tool for communicating with the public. It allows us to provide vital information on crime prevention and advice on keeping safe.'",

It won him the top spot on the annual Bloomberg Pay Index. Slumping to second place, Chenerie Energy's Houston-based chief executive Charif Souki was valued at $281 million. And now the firm has announced it is cutting his pay. In his prime: GoPro creator Nick Woodman, 39, is set to be named America's highest-paid CEO of 2014  Woodman's product - a camera which can be fixed to helmets, the body, or a hand-held pole - made waves in when it debuted in 2006.  They are used by professionals and hobbyists conquering six-foot waves, treacherous ski slopes, scrappy dirt track races and bungee jumps. The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife Jill giving birth to one of their sons.  The Californian surfing couple have come a long way since the business was founded in 2004 with one product: a waterproof film camera. Before sales took off, Woodman posed as the model for their self-made adverts. But his posing days didn't last long. In 2006, the firm launched its first digital camera. Three years later it began selling a high-definition camera. The cameras are light, small and waterproof. They have other uses besides sports. TV producers use them to film in areas where big professional cameras can't go. Since launching its high-definition camera in 2009, it has sold 8.5 million of them, including 3.8 million in 2013. Its cameras are sold in more than 25,000 stores and cost between $200 and $400.  The day the company first went public, they sold 3.6 million shares of GoPro stock to rake in an astounding $86 million before taxes.

But his posing days didn't last long Woodman's shares were worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at the IPO price.  As stock prices continue to increase, and including some of Woodman's other assets, Forbes estimates that his net worth is now more than $2.3 billion. Chinese tech manufacturer Foxconn, which owns about 11 million shares of GoPro stock that are worth a collective $425 million. Riverwood Capital, a private equity firm, currently has about $650 million in GoPro stock. Nick Woodman is the founder and CEO of GoPro, a camera which can be fixed to helmets, the body, equipment or a hand-held pole. They are used by professionals and hobbyists conquering 6ft waves, treacherous ski slopes, scrappy dirt track races and bungee jumps. The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife giving birth to one of their sons. They are WiFi capable, typically come with remotes for control and have a capacity of 64GB currently. They are also versatile thanks to numerous add-ons, including LCD screens, and the most expensive model is $400.  Woodman's father, Dean, has also found himself an overnight millionaire. The elder Woodman loaned his son $200,000 to help get GoPro off the ground. Dean Woodman - who sold none of his shares at the IPO - now owns $280 million in GoPro shares. As Forbes notes, that is a 140,000 percent return on his initial $200,000 investment.   Its list of competitors is short, but growing. Consumer electronics companies Garmin, Samsung and Sony have all entered the market. GoPro had the best-selling camcorder in 2013, according to government paperwork filed by the company. It also sells accessories such as cases, battery packs and mounts that help users attach their cameras to surfboards, helmets or their wrists. It also has a free app and software that lets users edit, store and publish their videos to their social media accounts including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. Additional growth may come from the wild videos its cameras create, which the company hopes to use to create a media company.   The Bloomberg Pay Index tracks the 100 highest-paid executives in firms that trade on US exchanges. The pay package is assessed by tracking each company's stock prices, which changes the value of their equity awards.

He received mail from around the world and got more mail in one day than the rest of the town combined, according to Fox News. On Friday night, his mother Carley Nickerson shared on a Facebook page, Danny's Warriors, that her 'precious sweet boy earned his angel wings' after a 'courageous 18 month battle'. Danny Nickerson (left), 6, of Massachusetts died of an inoperable brain tumor after a 'courageous 18-month battle' Last July, his request for a 'box of cards' for his sixth birthday went viral and he received more than 150,000 cards from around the world (above Nickerson last summer with the mail he received) 'Our lord came and carried his body to heaven,' she wrote on April 24. 'His body was so tired of fighting.  'He is now cancer free and running and playing and laughing with God and all of the other precious children. 'Prayers are needed for all of us right now. Please surround us in your prayers.' On Friday night, his mother, Carley Nickerson (pictured above with him), wrote that her 'precious sweet boy earned his angel wings' Nickerson was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glimoma (DIPG) in October 2013 and fought through 33 radiation treatments According to ABC News, doctors said that less than ten per cent of children with the disease, called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glimoma, live longer than 18 months. Nickerson was first diagnosed with the DIPG after he complained about having double vision. Over the course of four days, he saw multiple doctors before finally getting an MRI. 'After the MRI, we were taken into a small room and given the worst news we have ever heard,' Mrs Nickerson said when she learned of his diagnosis. 'Our lives fell apart, my heart felt like it exploded. There were no words to explain the pain that instantly hit my chest.' For his sixth birthday last July, he requested a 'box of cards' and received an overwhelming number in the mail after his mother asked people on Facebook to send her son a birthday card. On a Facebook page, Danny's Warriors, Mrs Nickerson wrote of her son's passing: 'He is now cancer free and running and playing and laughing with God and all of the other precious children' After Mrs Nickerson took to Facebook asking people to send her son a birthday card, they were 'shocked and overwhelmed' by the amount of mail they received To get all of the the mail to his home, it took four trucks and a U-Haul. He received cards from around the world and got more mail in one day than the rest of the town combined When his family received all of the cards, Mrs Nickerson said they were 'shocked and speechless', and that the cards included 'a picture of a fat cat on it and another with a cat blowing out candles' which made her son laugh. To get the mail to his Foxboro home, it took four trucks and a U-Haul, according to MyFoxBoston.com. Last summer, Nickerson was also met by police officers from around the state and members of the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium to celebrate his sixth birthday, according to CBS Boston. On a You Caring page for Nickerson, his mother wrote that he has fought through 33 radiation treatments and two clinical trials which consisted of chemotherapy. The page also said Nickerson enjoyed playing  with his brother, Matthew, and enjoyed anything that made him laugh. A mass will be held on Wednesday to celebrate his life at St. Mary's Church in Wrentham on Wednesday at 11am.",

      "src": "The UK's top prosecutor today told critics deriding her decision not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged child sex offences to challenge her in court. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge because she is convinced the Labour peer is not fit to plead because of his dementia. And in her first interview since she announced Lord Janner would not face trial she refused to quit because 'making the right decision is not a resigning issue'.  Fighting back: Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge over her decision not to charge Lord Janner and said she would not quit Victims and leading politicians have accused her of 'damaging public confidence' in the justice system with her ruling \u2013 even though there was a enough evidence to go ahead with a prosecution.  Mrs Saunders admitted herself that three investigations into claims made by 25 alleged victims over 25 years were botched  - but decided it was now too late to charge him. She told the Evening Standard today: 'If somebody wants to challenge my decision I'm not afraid. The proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review. 'I'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up. I thought long and hard before making it and I'm confident I got it right. My job is not to be populist.  'The medical evidence was very clear. He wouldn't be fit to stand trial, he wouldn't understand the questions, he wouldn't understand the process, he wouldn't be able to understand instructions.  'It's not to make decisions on the basis of what people want. It's about making the right decisions. Sometimes that means it won't be popular but if I'm fulfilling my duties as DPP that's the right thing to do.' Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trial Last night it emerged Mrs Saunders overruled the advice of two of the country's most senior barristers to allow Lord Janner to avoid a trial. Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. In particular, Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and corroborating accounts by victims during the two-year police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his Alzheimer's disease. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a 'trial of the facts' could have satisfied the need to get to the bottom of the appalling claims against the peer, whatever his mental state.  And MailOnline revealed last week that 19 dementia sufferers have been prosecuted for child sex offences and ten were in the past year. The Mail revealed today that Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him, it can be revealed. The move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the Labour peer for compensation. The flat, in an exclusive gated community near Hampstead Heath, North London, was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in March last year - the same month police raided Janner's Westminster office and three months after they had swooped on his home. In the four years after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009, the former Labour MP, 86, has claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances. Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raid Even earlier this month, on April 9, he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the House of Lords. A week later, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Janner would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from Alzheimer's that he could not even understand any charges against him, let alone answer them. This was despite the fact the CPS ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. Victims have accused bungling authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice. Child protection campaigners, MPs, police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said concerns over the decision were justified. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something 'very strange' about the ruling and Health Minister Norman Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of dementia sufferers being brought to trial. He added that the matter should be brought before a court because Mrs Saunders and the Crown Prosecution Service had made 'heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so'. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, when he was last seen in public Signed: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons Mr Hunt said London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been 'right' to express concern at the decision, adding: 'I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious.' Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and legal expert, said although there was strong evidence Lord Janner had dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. This week, leading politicians from seven parties demanded the decision be reversed. The group, led by Labour's Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times: 'As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.' A CPS spokesman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and that Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an 'ancillary matter'. At least ten men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010. Clare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial",

      "src": "Bitter: Tracey Taylor went on a violent rampage following the breakdown of her 20 year relationship A jilted florist used her car to ram her ex-fiance's Porsche as well as his new girlfriend's BMW while her two terrified daughters sat in the back. Furious Tracey Taylor, 34, caused more than \u00a313,000 worth of damage to the luxury cars including scratching the paintwork with a key and smashing the BMW's windscreen with a rock. Earlier that day she had attacked her former lover and his girlfriend, punching him on the ear and pulling her hair after barging her way into her home in Ratby, Leics. Then two days later she returned to the property and broke in through the front door, pushing her way past her love rival's 19-year-old student daughter before tearing a flatscreen TV off the wall and hurling a vase of roses across the room. When arrested she told the police she'd attacked the cars on February 18 this year because she saw they had a Porsche and a BMW between them when he'd left her 'penniless.'  Leicester Crown Court heard how Taylor had been struggling to come to terms with the breakdown of the 20 year relationship with the father of her two daughters, aged 12 and four, and a 15-year-old son.  Recorder Mark Hill QC, sentencing, told Taylor, of Desford, Leics: 'You were unable to control your temper and your appalling behaviour brings discredit upon you. 'You displayed a high level of anger and violence, carried out in the presence of two young children, causing extensive and serious damage.' Lynsey Knott, defending, said: 'It was a life-long relationship since she was 15. 'She's a devoted mother, has no previous convictions, and is ashamed two of her children were present. 'She'd assisted her partner with the running of the businesses and after the breakdown was left without a home, whilst waiting for a housing association property. Taylor received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement 'She was at rock-bottom and is truly sorry. Her doctor has increased her anti-depressant medication.' The court heard \u00a39,800 pounds' worth of damage was caused to the Porsche and \u00a33,800 to the BMW - including key scratch marks.  Florist Taylor admitted burglary, criminal damage and two counts of common assault. She received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement. She was also handed a five-year restraining order was made, banning her from contacting her ex-lover's new partner or her teenage daughter. Taylor's ex-partner, aged 40, who runs a car business, asked not to be named, but said after the case: 'It's been the most stressful year of my life, since we broke up. 'It's been a complete nightmare with all the damage, threats, outbursts and driving at me before crashing into the cars in front of our daughters. 'I can't forgive what she's done and I've split up with my girlfriend, because she couldn't cope with what's happened.

Robin Thomas, of Jonesboro, posted a sign on his truck that reads, 'Looking for a date? Would you date a single father?' The advertisement then shows his phone number and below reads, '*Ages 21 and up*'. Robin Thomas, of Jonesboro, Arkansas, posted a 'girlfriend wanted' advertisement on his truck after several failed attempts at online dating The father-of-three decided to put the sign on his truck after failing to find love online several times.  'I decided it can't be any worse than what I was doing,' Thomas told KAIT8.   The retired cook said that he's looking for a woman who is 'normal and down-to-earth' and closer to his own age, hoping for 'at least 28'.  Thomas has three kids, aged six to 11, who he said that his kids think the sign is 'cute'. He added that most of his free time is when he kids are in school and he's not much of a party animal Thomas has joint-custody of one of his sons, so he's looking for a woman who lives close to him. 'When the kids are in school, that's my free time,' he told KAIT8. 'Also, I'm not what you'd call a party person.'  Thomas said he enjoys to play pool, bowl, bar-be-cue and spend time at the river with his kids, who are aged six to 11.  And no need to worry about embarrassing his kids with the sign, Thomas said, because 'they think its cute'.",

Tom Ryan, 40, was struck by a Toyota while making deliveries on Staten Island, leaving the hanging by a thread. Onlookers used a shirt as a tourniquet in a desperate attempt to stop the bleeding. Witness Moe Sattar, a mechanic at the tyre store on Hylan Boulevard, said: 'Tom was screaming. 'One of his legs was laying next to him under the truck. Then he got quiet when he was bleeding out.' Mr Ryan, a married father-of-two, was taken to Staten Island University before being transferred by air ambulance to the trauma unit at Belleview hospital, FDNY sources told the New York Post. He has lost one leg, but is expected to live, a UPS representative said. The driver of the Toyota, which had North Carolina licence plates, told officers he swerved to avoid a pedestrian, according to law enforcement sources. Mr Sattar backed up this account, adding that the driver was believed to be a teenager. The NYPD said no charges were filed against the driver. He said the jaywalker stopped to rubberneck but left before emergency services reached the scene. According to Mr Ryan's Facebook page, his son, Malachy, believed to be aged eight or nine, was hit by a bus around four years ago while walking home from school. Malachy was a 'bloody mess' and needed a neck brace, but doctors said 'he would be OK', he wrote.

The 'kick and kill' strategy aims to eradicate the virus, by stimulating the immune system - the body's natural defence mechanism - with a vaccine. Researchers believe the injection could flush out dormant HIV hiding in white blood cells with a chemical 'kick', allowing a boosted immune system to identify and kill the cells. The theory, developed by researchers at University College London, the University of Oxford and the University of North Carolina, is based on a single patient case study. Scientists hope a new 'kick and kill' vaccine could flush out HIV hidden in the body before stimulating a person's own immune system to kill the cells  'Our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails,' study co-author Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said. 'We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, as we still need to develop and test effective vaccines, but this study takes us one step closer by showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce.'  The study looked at a single 59-year-old man in London who was an 'elite controller' - meaning his immune system could control HIV for a long period of time without his needing treatment. Elite controllers, who make up 0.3 per cent of HIV patients, eventually require treatment to prevent progression to AIDS. But they can go a lot longer without treatment because their immune systems are more active against HIV.   The patient in the study had both HIV and myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow.  The bone marrow produces white blood cells, including those that help to control HIV. Pioneering new treatments for HIV, flu, ebola and cancer are being developed by scientists harnessing man-made DNA. Experts have discovered how to create strands of artificial DNA, each mimicking a different killer disease, and inject them into patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will then be able to recognise the threats and eliminate them. Inovio, one of the companies behind the technique, has begun trials in humans, after strong results in the lab. The American company is using the method to attack flu, ebola and certain types of cancer \u2013 as well as HIV and hepatitis. Experts have already started trials on female patients to see if they can stop them developing cervical cancer.  To treat the patient's myeloma, his bone marrow was completely removed and replaced using his own stem cells.  When the bone marrow was removed, the immune system was severely impaired, allowing the HIV to re-activate and replicate.  This caused the level of virus in his bloodstream to rise from fewer than 50 copies per millilitre to approximately 28,000 copies per ml before is immune system's function returned. When the patient's immune function returned about two weeks after the transplant, the levels of HIV in his bloodstream rapidly fell.  His immune system reduced HIV levels at a similar rate to the most powerful treatments available, bringing them back down to 50 copies per ml within six weeks. Professor Deenan Pillay, also of UCL, said: 'By measuring the strength of the immune system required to keep this virus under control in this rare individual, we have a better idea of the requirements for successful future treatment.  'We also managed to identify the specific immune cells that fought the infection.  'This is a single patient study, but nevertheless it is often the unusual patients who help us to understand the HIV disease process.' The man was not given any anti-HIV drugs, due to concerns about side-effects affecting his cancer treatment. The researchers noted it is possible that an equally strong immune response in combination with powerful drugs could have cured the HIV completely, however they state that is far from certain.   Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said: 'Our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails. We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, but this study takes us one step closer, showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce' 'We need to be cautious in interpreting observations from a single subject,' said Dr Nilu Goonetilleke, who began working on the study at the University of Oxford and is now at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  'However, demonstration even from a single subject, that our immune system can rapidly control HIV-1 tells us a lot about the types of immune responses we should target and augment through vaccination.' Dr Gupta adds: 'Drugs to stimulate reactivation of dormant HIV are still imperfect, and we do not know if they would be able to flush out all of the HIV from the body.  'Likewise, it remains to be seen whether a vaccine could enable a normal HIV patient's immune system to kill HIV with the full strength of an elite controller.  'Our study is a proof of principle and the results are promising, but it is unlikely to lead to a cure for at least a decade.' The study was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.",

The London Mayor praised the Coalition for having kept down unemployment and not returning to the dole queues of 1980s Britain. He said the fact that more jobs were being created was 'one of the absolute moral triumphs' of the government. Boris Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, has set out his vision of 'moral purpose' in business and politics The comments by Mr Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, will be seen as an attempt to position himself as a future party leader. Labour's Stephen Pound accused the London Mayor of 'breath-taking cheek' Last night Labour's Stephen Pound, who is fighting to defend a nearby seat, said: 'I'm thinking of a sentence with the words pot, kettle and black in it.' 'It seems that Boris's motto is \"do as I say, not as I do\". It really is breath-taking cheek. He obviously has a different definition of \"moral\" to most of my constituents.' In 2004, Mr Johnson admitted a four-year affair with the journalist Petronella Wyatt while he was married to his second wife Marina, with whom he has four children. Five years later he fathered a child by Helen Macintyre, an unpaid adviser in the London Assembly. Mr Johnson spoke about morality in an interview with the London Evening Standard, saying he believed wealth creation was there to fund public services such as schools and hospitals. He said: 'I think this country was harrowed by the experience of mass unemployment in the early Eighties. 'One of the absolute moral triumphs of this Coalition government has been to get us through the worst recession for 50 years without seeing a return to those levels of unemployment.'",

Blagojevich was infamously caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected president in 2008. Fade to gray: Once famed for his mop of blacker than black hair, disgraced Democrat Rod Blagojevich, 58, has really let his haircare regime go while he serves his prison time Back in his days as governor of Illinois, Blagojevich was famed for his boot polish black hair He was impeached and removed from office by the state Legislature in early 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges. Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver. The photos, the first of Blagojevich in prison, were first published by the National Enquirer. The photos show the former governor sitting at a desk, reading a book and wearing glasses and sitting outside in shorts and a wife beater shirt. While he continues to awaiting word on a last-ditch appeal, Blagojevich has daily contact with his family and teaches the history of war battles to other inmates, his attorney said. Last July lawyers attempted to argue that a high court ruling in McCutcheon v. the Federal Election Commission in April 2014 bolstered their view that Blagojevich was engaged in legal, run-of-the-mill political horse trading, not corruption. The McCutcheon ruling, they argued, found that soliciting contributions crosses the line into corruption only when a politician makes a clear, explicit promise to take official action in return for a donation. Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver after he was caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected president In that context, defense attorneys said the trial judge was wrong to set a lower standard for jurors by telling them, to convict, they only needed to find that Blagojevich sought donations 'knowing or believing' it would be given for some official act. But government attorneys responded saying that Blagojevich's legal team hadn't correctly characterized the Supreme Court's findings in McCutcheon. 'The decision provides no support for Blagojevich's argument on appeal,' the two-page filing said.  'Nothing in the (McCutcheon) decision suggests that an exchange of contributions for specific official acts is quid pro quo corruption only if the arrangement is stated 'explicitly' or 'expressly.'' The Chicago-based appellate court has been considering Blagojevich's appeal for more than a year months. It's unclear when it might issue a decision.",

A new post has been opened after Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket on Wednesday, with the job title also scrapped. Instead ECB chief executive Tom Harrison is keen to have Downton's replacement focus solely on performances, rather than administration duties, which has brought a number of former England captains into the fray. Michael Vaughan has re-affirmed his interest in taking on the newly created role of director of England cricket Ashes 2005 winning skipper Vaughan is among the early frontrunners for the new role with the ECB Ashes 2005 winning skipper Vaughan is among the early frontrunners although the former Yorkshire batsman admitted in his column with the Daily Telegraph he would need to know more about the role before committing. Vaughan, who since retirement has been a pundit and commentator for numerous media outlets, said: 'It will take honesty and unity to make a change. In (incoming ECB chairman) Colin Graves and Tom Harrison we have a chance to change English cricket and admit our problems. 'Let us finally do it. Stop looking at what your own county needs and ask what is best for English cricket moving forward and what is right for the England team to sustain a proper period of success. Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket 'For the first time since retiring six years ago I am open to a conversation with the ECB. I am passionate about English cricket. I love the game and I always want England to move forward and be successful. 'I have a vision for the game and I think I will be one of many ex-players who will be more than willing to talk to the ECB to see what exactly the role is and how much influence it will wield over the future structure of our game. 'The brief has to be wider and more powerful than Paul's to have any real impact on England.'",

The Switzerland international joined the Italians from Bayern Munich in January for a fee in the region of \u00a312million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract. The 23-year-old made a fine start to his Inter career but has tailed off in recent weeks and has found himself dropped to the bench for the previous two Serie A matches. Xherdan Shaqiri joined Inter Milan from Bayern Munich in the January transfer window And it has been suggested that Inter are looking to offload the attacking midfielder at the end of the season, but Mancini has rubbished the speculation insisting Shaqiri can have a big future in Italy. 'This Shaqiri thing is completely made up,' he told reporters. 'We bought Shaqiri last January because we think that he can have a big future at Inter. Then during the season, there might be a moment when a player's form drops, and there are other players that in that moment are able to step in. So that's the only situation going on right now. 'Shaqiri has our full confidence. He is our player. Then he has also changed his team, so it's normal that he might struggle at a certain stage. Shaqiri has been dropped to the bench by Roberto Mancini in recent matches 'It's not that he can join a new club and altogether be the one that single-handedly wins games by himself. 'He will always have a drop in form at a certain stage so in that moment there are other players ready to step in - they are normally there for that reason. So one only plays when he deserves to play.  'We bought Shaqiri because we believe in his qualities,' Mancini added. The Inter boss insists Shaqiri will not be leaving the club despite reports to the contrary 'Then if Bayern [Munich] decided to sell him, it's because they have so many players that eventually they have reached the conclusion that Shaqiri is a young player and that he needs to play. 'Inter could be the right solution for him and we are happy about this. I am sure that Shaqiri next season will achieve great things.'",

Sexual predator Henri Morris was told he would serve 10 years behind bars for his 'calculated and choreographed' crime.  The 67-year-old was caught in an FBI sting after investigators were approached by one of his victims in 2012. Henri Morris, 67, was jailed for 10 years after admitting drugging a female employee during a business trip in order to take naked photos of her She told them that her drink was spiked by the married businessman after they traveled together from Houston, Texas, to New Jersey for work. The woman said when she woke up she was naked and her boss was standing over her and taking pictures on his mobile phone. The FBI arrested Morris at Bush County Airport after the woman, who has not been named, covertly worked with them. When his bags were search they found his 'kit,' which included strong sedatives and Viagra. A task force was set up to probe Morris and in total they found eight female employees who claimed to have been abused by him. His defense team initially tried to argue that the women all willingly drank to excess with clients and that no abuse had ever occurred. Ahead of his trial Morris pleaded guilty to a single charge of drugging and abusing a female employee, in exchange for prosecutors dropping other abuse charges. MarriedMorris of Houston, Texas, was the president of Edible Software Solutions  'There is no way to adequately express my remorse and my abject humiliation,' Morris said during a 10 minute address at his sentencing hearing, according to the Houston Chronicle. 'I apologize to anyone who I have hurt and beg for their forgiveness.'   US District Judge Melinda Harmon sentenced him to 10 years in federal prison without the possibility of parole. She also reportedly ordered that he spend the rest of his life under the supervision of the US Bureau of Prisons, according to the newspaper.",

' mario valencia ( above ) was in the hospital for two days after being hit by rapiejko . but apparently ignoring his advice , rapiejko overtakes the officer 's car , before speeding straight toward valencia . seconds later , his vehicle mounts the curb and smashes into the suspect 's body . valencia is sent flying into the air , while the car crashes through a concrete wall before coming to a halt amid debris . the other officer can be heard shouting in shock : ' oh ! jesus christ , man down . ' valencia was rushed to university of arizona medical center in serious condition following the crash and was eventually booked into jail two days later . sergeant chris warren said at the time that valencia ' was a dangerous felon who 'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning ' . this crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at , vandalism and burglary at the tucson baptist temple , a home invasion and theft of a car . it culminated with the alleged theft of a rifle from walmart , after which he was hit by rapiejko 's police vehicle . rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash , but soon reinstated after the pima county attorney 's office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing . valencia is facing several felony charges for his alleged crime spree .",

' fellow rider paul gavrilov , 35 , said : ' this accident should have been avoided because he could have been killed . if there were better cycle ways and proper access to the ones that exist it would make it safer .

' on the morning of friday , april 10 , 2015 , the chimpanzees of royal burgers ' zoo once again proved how intelligent they are , ' a spokesman for the zoo said . the incident happened during filming for a reality show set in the zoo . programme makers had hoped to use the drone to capture the enclosure from above . ' today , for the second season of the national television program burgers ' zoo natuurlijk , film takes were planned with a drone , with which spectacular images of the animals and their habitats could be made from above . ' the drone was able to fly around the zoo - before arriving at the chimp enclosure . ' once the drone arrived at the chimpanzee quarters the intelligent primates immediately discovered the spying little plane and right away armed themselves with long sticks against this inquisitive electronic intruder , ' the zaoo revealed . one of the chimpanzees was high up in a tree with a long branch . ' apparently very calm and satisfied , half asleep in the morning sun , the primate let the drone make its curious images . ' until .... . the drone got just a bit too close . once grounded , the chimp investigates its prey , taking a selfie in the process - before eventually wandering off . ' like a flash the chimpanzee struck out with the long stick she had held hidden behind her body . with a direct hit the animal knocked the drone to the ground , where the group of primates quickly overpowered the ' prey ' . ' with much enjoyment they very efficiently dismantled the play thing . ' during the entire moment of action the camera kept rolling , so despite the completely destroyed drone this still provided some very special images !

' the pilot had followed the remote - controlled craft in the back of a pick - up truck while the stunt was filmed by a local tv channel . the dutch restaurant had to settle for a more traditional method of delivery following the crash . personal drones have surged in popularity with amazon alone selling 10,000 of them every month . however , learning to fly a drone \u2014 flying devices that often carry cameras and can be navigated remotely by smartphones or controllers \u2014 is something that requires some time and patience say experts . in flight : the drone carrying asparagus tips was flying them to a michelin - star restaurant in the netherlands . up in smoke : the drone operator looks on as the machine crashed into a field as it went to make an asparagus delivery to a top dutch restaurant . a tgi friday restaurant in new york launched mistletoe drone to tempt diners into kissing which backfired when a photographer , who was invited to cover the event , was struck in the face by the four - bladed machine . in february , a restaurant chain in singapore announced that it will start using drones as waiters operating from the kitchen and bar to the dining areas .",

' there has been a lot of public pressure for me to resign , a lot of interest groups that want me to resign , ' mr ritchie told abc radio . ' but the main thing for me was i felt my ability to be effective in the role was now diminished and that 's the most fundamental thing . ' the university 's women 's collective had launched a petition on the website\u00a0change.org to have mr ritchie removed from his role in the tuu . the petition said mr ritchie ' was elected to the role of women 's officer unconstitutionally and unethically and yet the tuu staff refuses to disqualify his candidacy ' . however , tuu guidelines did not state a preferred gender for the role , saying only that ' an interest in higher education and student issues would be advantageous ' . the university 's student union has now introduced a requirement that candidates sign a statutory declaration confirming they identify as female . the state 's anti-discrimination commissioner , robin banks , also said there was no legal reason why a man could not occupy the role of women 's officer . ' in my opinion , it 's irrelevant if ( the position is ) held by a female or a male . in this election i believe i was the best person for the role , ' mr ritchie said . ' if you ca n't get a society where women feel they can approach men about a number of issues and men feel they can approach women about a number of issues , how do you really make progress ?

' i did n\u2019t really want to tell either one of our families for a long time what we were planning . we kept mum about it to most people but if we did tell friends , they all said we were crazy .

' mr anderson had been a senior learning mentor at the school from 2001 , when he was already a liverpool councillor . he eventually rose through the ranks to become full - time leader of the council in 2010 , effectively stopping his role as a mentor , but he continued taking payments from his former employer . when the school became an academy in 2011 , and therefore had greater freedom over its finances , it ceased paying mr anderson , leading to his discrimination claim . mr anderson , who is paid an \u00a3 80,000 salary , tried to sue the school ( pictured ) for discrimination after it stopped the payments , saying he was being punished for a ' philosophical belief ' in public service . mr anderson said that his claim was no about getting more money , but about protecting his lucrative public sector pension pot . a tribunal ruled that mr anderson was unfairly dismissed , but that it was ' 100 per cent likely ' the school would have sacked him following a consultation , so he was not entitled to compensation . it also ruled that , while mr anderson 's belief in public service is a protected status , he had not been discriminated against .",

' he was concerned for the health and safety of the residents , but questioned how the situation in the property could have gotten to such a point . mr mar said : ' we certainly want seniors to stay in their communities as long as possible , but when people are n\u2019t getting adequate health care and attention , this is what happens . ' this appears to be a nightmare of what can happen when people age in place for too long , ' he added . ' we need to identify what the triggers are for the city to step in . ' he told the daily mail online that he heard the body was wrapped up in a carpet and described that , from the outside , it looked like the home was abandoned . residents said the woman had not been seen in years while police described it as the worst case of hoarding they had ever seen . when city workers arrived to clean up the body on wednesday , they reportedly struggled to get in the door because the house was filled with so much debris . the mess was said to have included mold and piles of trash that reached the ceiling . they were forced to call in professional workers . the chronicle quote a firefighter saying the body was lightweight and wrapped in a blanket . it is not clear where it was discovered .",

' this means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight . a small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work off . indulging in two hot cross buns ( without jam and butter ) will take up to 50 minutes of running to work off . it may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of easter treats . for four solid mini chocolate easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules . a female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes , whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes . one medium chocolate bunny takes two and a half to three hours of kayaking with women needing to paddle for half an hour longer than men to work it off . the key for easter indulgence is noting our ' energy in ' and ' energy out ' and balancing food and fitness . experts are advising that it is better to manage our energy consumption than to try and work it off afterward . two hot cross buns takes up to 50 minutes running and if you have lathered it with butter and jam , it would take 80 minutes of running . exercise physiologist alex lawrence from exercise sport science australia has said that many australians still struggle to maintain a healthy weight as most do not realise how many kilojoules are in the foods we consume . ' it 's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption , than to try and work off the energy after you 've taken it in , ' he said . lawrence is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat . he advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eating part of your lifestyle so that you can indulge in treats every now and then . ' what we 're trying to encourage people to do is make better lifestyle choices ; to eat treat foods in moderation and to make sure they are physically active most of the time . that way when holidays , like easter , come around they do n't have to feel like they have to deny themselves , ' he said .",

      "src": "two trainee obstetricians have been removed from a newly developed $ 2 million hospital in western australia reportedly over concerns about the quality of service and problems with patient safety at the obstetric unit . the concerns around fiona stanley hospital , in southwest perth , were revealed to thewest australian by unnamed sources . however , according to health authorities , the move was purely based on reshuffling junior medical faculty . the latest potential developments at the hospital follow recent reports that blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments . the $ 2 billion fiona stanley hospital in southwest perth was found to have blood and bone fragments of some its medical instruments . the west australian was told junior doctors were moved to ' maximise training opportunities ' by a state committee that organises both accreditation and training for the royal australian and new zealand college of obstetricians and gynaecologists . the hospital went on ' baby bypass ' when the maternity unit opened four months ago , due to an unexpectedly high number of women giving birth . the hospital consequently had to direct expectant mothers to other hospitals . this week the ranzcog told the west australian that the obstetrics unit , which opened on december 2 last year , was approved for training in march . michael gannon , president of the australian medical association wa , told the west australian he knew of issues surrounding the recently opened obstetrics unit . he said concerns of the unit 's services were similar to others at the hospital , due to planning issues from years ago . the hospital was stripped of its medical service provider serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in february . earlier in the week , it was revealed that the hospital 's medical service provider serco failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in february . the company was fined $ 60,000 and was subject to department of health workers auditing its staff , but the hospital was reportedly operating with poorly sanitised instruments , reported the abc . australian medical association wa president michael gannon noted recent reports that some instruments contained blood and human matter . ' there 's been reports of bits of bone on some orthopaedic equipment , there 's been reports , that are really hard to believe , of blood still being seen on some instruments , ' he said . ' so this gives us great concern . ' . dr gannon said the latest revelations will further damage the hospital 's public image and likely cause a loss of morale within its workforce . ' i ca n't imagine how people must feel if they 've got surgery booked at the hospital at some stage , ' he said .",

' this measure is limited to five skus of classic hummus sold nationwide , ' sabra dipping co. said in a release . ' to date , no other sabra product is affected by this recall . ' scroll down to see the batches of hummus being recalled . listeria concerns have led to thousands of classic hummus containers being part of a voluntary recall , sabra dipping co. said monday . the company said that ' the potential for contamination was discovered when a routine , random sample collected at a retail location on march 30th , 2015 by the michigan department of agriculture and rural development , tested positive for listeria monocytogenes . ' the positive test happened at a kroger in port huron , michigan , a mdard spokeswoman told the detroit free press . the newspaper reported that michigan officials contacted both the fda and inspectors located in virginia . sabra has a production plant in virginia 's chesterfield county . sabra dipping co. said that customers will be refunded if they return the products to stores . both supermarkets and food service accounts had received products , the company said . the company said ' listeria monocytogenes is an organism , which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children , frail or elderly people , and others with weakened immune systems . ' although healthy individuals may suffer only short - term symptoms such as high fever , severe headache , stiffness , nausea , abdominal pain and diarrhea , listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women .

' fellow rider paul gavrilov , 35 , said : ' this accident should have been avoided because he could have been killed . if there were better cycle ways and proper access to the ones that exist it would make it safer .

' in a statement , the port of seattle expressed its sympathies to afoa and his family for the accident . the agency says it 's reviewing the decision . if it decides to appeal the verdict , it could delay payment of afoa 's award .",

' if you are bailing out , you are not supposed to leave the state \u2013 let alone the country , ' deputy utah county attorney craig johnson told ksl.com . ' if he had been successful , there is no way for us to extradite him back to utah \u2013 especially with his ties to the royal family . ' alshammari was arrested in march , nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped , while on a date . the victim led police to alshammari at this apartment complex near utah valley university . he was booked into the utah county jail on march 26 , but $ 100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later . alshammari 's attorney ron yengich declined to comment on tuesday , saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest . when asked about alshammari 's connections to the saudi arabian royal family , yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege . police did not offer details about the royal connection , besides saying that federal officials reported alshammari is related to royalty and has family connections to the saudi arabian government .",

' plain clothes police are attempting to drive down pickpocket crimes in busy shopping areas like oxford street , pictured . he said many arrive in britain on a six - month visa before heading off on a ' european tour ' and police are constantly monitoring cctv to keep tabs on gangs and their recruits . organised international gangs of thieves will often spend a short time operating in london before flying to the likes of madrid , barcelona and milan for the same purpose - all as part of moves to avoid detection . dc bond , whose squad has seen a 50 per cent reduction in thefts over the last year , told vice that ' anecdotally ' about 70 per cent of arrested pickpockets were romanians or bulgarians , ten per cent algerians and five per cent chileans with the rest uk - based .
