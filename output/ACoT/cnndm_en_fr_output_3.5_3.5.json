The France international was given a second yellow card for the offence, but head coach John Carver feels it should have been a straight red. 'The club will deal with that situation,' he said when asked if Sissoko - who is now banned for two matches - would be punished. Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva clutches his leg after Moussa Sissoko's tackle at Anfield Sissoko hands the captain's armband to boss John Carver as he leaves the pitch after being sent off 'He knows he was wrong. He was fortunate not to get a straight red and he agreed with me. 'He apologised afterwards to Lucas, which was important. 'But you think captains would lead by example. We have to improve our discipline. I will be looking at that.' Meanwhile, Carver says Newcastle cannot rely on the shortcomings of others to preserve their Premier League status. The Magpies are the division's most out-of-form side having lost five on the spin, scoring just one goal along the way. Liverpool's players surround Lucas following Sissoko's dangerous tackle during Monday night's game Raheem Sterling bends the ball past Tim Krul to open the scoring in Liverpool's 2-0 win against Newcastle They are nine points clear of danger with six matches to play, but Carver says it's about time they started helping themselves, starting with Sunday's visit of Spurs. 'These two home games (Spurs followed by Swansea) are massive for us. I'm not bothered about performances, we need results,' he said. 'I'm not worrying about that (relegation) at the moment, and the good thing is we have four games at home. 'But we need to start winning now. We can't rely on others teams. We can't afford to ease off, I have always said that. 'We have gone through a rough spell. It's down to me now to get players in right frame of mind.'

The fast food giant has caused fury after installing metal studs outside its branch in Leeds city centre, which critics say are there to stop people  sleeping rough. McDonald's has defended the use of the spikes, claiming they were installed two years ago in an attempt to stop anti-social behaviour, not target the homeless. Uproar: A petition has been started to get the spikes removed from outside this Leeds McDonald's and 70,000 have backed the campaign But critics say they have been put in because they are uncomfortable to sleep on and installed on areas which used to be benches. Isobella DeMartino set up the petition to have them removed and has received support from across the globe.  Row: Critics say the spikes were installed to target the homeless but McDonald's say it is only about anti-social behaviour 'Anti-homeless spikes show complete disregard and lack of respect for homeless people who struggle every day,' she said. 'Spikes have been installed, presumably to prevent people sleeping there. 'The fact that the spikes exist shows how little people care about homeless people.' She added: 'Every time I'm in Leeds I see many ignore homeless people, not even bothering to smile at them let alone try to help them or give charity. I cannot imagine how painful and lonely it must be to be homeless. 'They deserve our attention and care, this issue cannot be ignored.' A spokeswoman for McDonald's said: 'The studs in question are not an 'anti- homeless' measure, as has been suggested. 'They have been in place for around two years and were introduced Following discussions with the police, in response to issues we were experiencing with antisocial behaviour.

The Nantucket wooden chair, which once sat on a first-class promenade of the ill-fated ship, was salvaged by a search team from the Atlantic Ocean after the Titanic sank in 1912.  Dubbed 'one of the rarest types of Titanic collectable', the chair is too fragile to sit on, but has been carefully preserved, having been owned by a British collector for the past 15 years. A 103-year-old deckchair recovered from the wreck of the Titanic is expected sold for \u00a3100,000 at auction The ship's log records six or seven deckchairs being picked up and taken back to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia. One was given by a crew member to Captain Julien Lemarteleur, who had previously worked on board the Mackay-Bennett.  The anonymous seller kept it by a large window overlooking the sea at his home on the south coast, never sat on it due to its fragile state and instead used it as a display item.  It was sold yesterday at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Devizes, Wiltshire, to a UK buyer.  Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, described the piece as one of 'the most important [bits] of Titanic memorabilia around'.   He said: 'It is incredibly rare to find something of that size that was on Titanic, was salvaged and that still exists today. Six or seven recovered deckchairs were stacked on the deck of the Mackay-Bennett as it arrived in Nova Scotia Titanic (above) sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14 It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic He said that he was 'very, very pleased' with the price. The chair is made of teak wood and has an adjustable footrest at the front. It is 57 inches long, 23 inches wide and 35 inches tall. It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic.  Upon his death in 1973, Capt Lemarteleur gave the chair to colleague Captain Robin Lee. The current owner acquired it in 2001. Sold with the chair was an in depth 'provenance package' that authenticates history and association with Titanic. Captain Julien Lemarteleur (above), who collected the chair from the Mackay-Bennett more than 100 years ago It includes a signed affidavit from Margarete Pennington, who was Mr Lemarteleur's housekeeper in the 1960s. In it she states: 'I personally saw the deckchair that Captain Lemarteleur told me about on many occasions. He said that various pieces of debris taken from the ocean including this Titanic deckchair he acquired. 'I recognise the chair as the same chair I saw in the captain's garage and of which the captain identified as coming from the Titanic.' Craig Sopin, 57, a lawyer from Philadelphia, owns one of the world's largest collections of Titanic memorabilia. He also authenticated the chair and said: 'It isn't often that one has the opportunity to acquire such an important part of Titanic's story. 'For such a significant item to have such a meticulous chain of custody is nothing short of astonishing. Its history can be traced from the auction house back to Titanic itself.' Titanic sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14. A ship, the Carpathia, picked up more than 700 survivors in lifeboats hours later and took them back to New York. White Star Line chartered four ships, including the Halifax-based cable-laying vessel the Mackay-Bennett, to recover the bodies.",

From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.",

      "src": "The Wikipedia official who accused Grant Shapps of doctoring his own online biography was exposed yesterday as a former Liberal Democrat member. The Tory party chairman had been accused this week of using an anonymous user ID to delete embarrassing facts about his past and add unflattering details about his political rivals. But yesterday it emerged that the senior Wikipedia administrator who investigated the allegations - following a tip-off from the left-wing Guardian - was a former Lib-Dem member. Richard Symonds, 29, who goes by the online name 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry', is one of the UK's top administrators for the website. He once described himself as 'Liberal Democrat to the last'. Scroll down for video  Volunteer: Richard Symonds, who joined the Wikipedia project in 2004, says he was not being political Mr Symonds decided to block a user called 'Contribsx' on Tuesday after concluding the account was probably operated either by Mr Shapps or under his 'clear direction'. Mr Shapps angrily denied the claims, insisting the story was 'untrue from start to finish'. Mr Symonds' decision was also criticised by other Wikipedia activists, who warned that the site should not be used to 'play politics' and referred the case to an internal arbitration committee. One user wrote: 'I don't know if 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry' did anything wrong but it's just rather obscure, and doing this during the peak campaign time for the UK 2015 elections as some sort of assignment from a journalist seems odd.' Mr Symonds, from Bow, East London, described himself on Twitter as 'Liberal Democrat (to the last)' before deleting his profile yesterday. He joined other party members who signed a letter to The Guardian in January last year calling for Lord Rennard to have the Lib-Dem whip withdrawn over his refusal to apologise for making unwanted advances to female activists. The internet expert, who has served in the Royal Naval Reserve, has been a Wikipedia volunteer since 2004 and became an administrator for the website in 2007. He is also a paid employee of Wikimedia UK, a charity which promotes the volunteer-written encyclopedia. Furious denials: Grant Shapps yesterday continued to deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes Among his Facebook friends is Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who married Tony Blair's former diary secretary Kate Garvey in 2012. He was once featured in a BBC profile that called him 'one of the UK's top Wikipedians' and reported that he spent up to eight hours a day working on the site. Responding to the criticism yesterday, Mr Symonds insisted he was not a Lib-Dem activist and said he would never let his political views interfere with his Wikipedia work. He added: 'I have never considered myself 'active' in any party, although I have been a lapsed member of the Lib Dems on and off, for probably a year in total since 2010.' Mr Symonds toned down his conclusions about Mr Shapps' possible connections to 'Contribsx', revisions to one of his Wikipedia pages show. At first he claimed the Tory chairman ran the account either directly or indirectly, but later he changed this to suggest simply that the account was run by a user called 'Hackneymarsh' who was linked to Mr Shapps' office by The Guardian in 2012. Mr Symonds admitted that Wikipedia's top officials had 'chastised' him for his handling of the case, although he refused to back down yesterday. He said: 'While a link has clearly been drawn between Hackneymarsh and Contribsx, it is impossible to know who was sitting behind the keyboard of Contribsx. 'But given the nature of edits, I suspect that it was Mr Shapps or someone close to him.' The Liberal Democrats used the claims to poke fun at the Tory chairman when the story broke on Tuesday night, and senior figures in the party continued mocking him yesterday. Lib-Dem leader Nick Clegg said he believed the denials but then joked that the person behind the account could have been 'Michael Green', the pseudonym used by Mr Shapps to promote get-rich-quick schemes before he became an MP. A Lib-Dem spokesman said Mr Symonds had 'no connection to Lib Dem HQ'. 'The first time we saw this story was in the Guardian, and the first time we know about him was when we were asked about him this afternoon,' he added. Minister Justine Greening, left, and Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby, right, were among those mentioned in the Wikipedia edits Mr Shapps yesterday continued to furiously deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes, and Tory cabinet ministers rallied behind him. He said: 'It's categorically untrue. It's absolutely nothing to do with me. It's just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.' David Cameron came to his defence, insisting the Welwyn Hatfield MP was doing a 'great job'. Wikimedia UK spokesman Stevie Benton said to the best of his knowledge Mr Symonds did not brief the Liberal Democrats about his actions. 'I would be incredibly surprised if he had done and would say it's out of character,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'I've worked with Richard for three and a half years and his politics have never entered into anything in that time.' The Guardian rejected criticism that its story did not made it plain that it had prompted the Wikipedia inquiry into alleged links between 'Contribsx' and Mr Shapps. A spokeswoman for the paper said: 'The article clearly states that this was a Guardian investigation which brought to light some potential breaches of Wikipedia's own rules, which were then communicated to the site's administrators.' Unite leader Len McCluskey has become embroiled in a claim against his trade union for bullying and sexual harassment. As part of a constructive dismissal claim under investigation by an employment tribunal, former union official Sally Nailard has accused the Unite general secretary of calling her a 'scab'. The 50-year-old former regional officer based at Heathrow is seeking undisclosed compensation. The case lifts the lid on alleged 'discrimination, misogyny and bullying' at the hard-Left union. The chairman of the employment tribunal in Watford, Isabel Manley, described the case as a 'sad and sorry tale'. More than half of Labour candidates in its 106 target seats are linked to Unite. Mr McCluskey is one of several union officials cited in Miss Nailard's claim. She resigned from her \u00a347,000 position last August, following an alleged 18-month campaign of bullying and harassment. Her evidence submitted to the tribunal, seen by the Independent, relates to a copy of an interview she gave to Sky News in 1997 after a cabin crew strike which she didn't take part in. Her evidence states: 'If I was such a \"scab\" as Len McCluskey later said, I would have volunteered to operate as crew over the strike.' The tribunal continues.",

Elijah McKenna suffered two wide, bloody gashes on his back of his head and numerous deep bite marks all over his face and body after his neighbor's three dogs attacked him near his grandmother's home in Moore, Oklahoma, Saturday.

As of Monday, they were still seen in a neighbor's yard  Alyssa says she went outside to check on her sibling, who is deaf, when she heard his screams and spotted a trio of large rottweilers biting the child in the brush by a dirt road. Setting aside concerns for her own safety, Alyssa ran over and scared off the hounds so she could tend to Elijah. The wounded boy could stand up or walk on his own, so his little sister picked him up and carried him home. 'I was terrified, but I saved his life,' Alyssa told News Channel 4. When Elijah was brought to a nearby hospital for treatment, he immediately went into surgery. The injured child, who turned 11 Tuesday, was later released home with 40 staples on his head. He is now learning to walk again. Justice: Rhianna Bravenec (right), Alyssa and Elijah's mother, said she wants all three dogs euthanized Strong: The 9-year-old girl picked up her big brother and carried him home because he was unable to walk on his own after the attack  In recovery: Elijah, who celebrated his 11th birthday Tuesday, is now learning how to walk again  On Monday, the animals that attacked Elijah were still seen roaming around the neighbor's yard. Dog owner Martin Tidwell said that what happened to the 9-year-old was terrible. Rhianna Bravenec, Alyssa and Elijah's mother, said she wants all three dogs euthanized.

'If I knew I had an incurable disease, maybe I would do a full body scan and have a digital replica created,' Dr Rizzo told DailyMail.com. 'And I would sit down for 20 hours and have people ask me questions about my life and what I think about different things.' He says this can all be programmed into virtual reality to create a living record of someone that people can interact with using VR headsets such as Oculus Rift. But experts are divided over how this can impact a user's mental health. Some argue that it can provide real comfort and support in times of grief, while others say it may prevent people from moving on from trauma. Bina48 is a robotic head that uses a 'Mind Clone' of the memories, belief and feelings of a real person It may be possible to live forever by uploading your memories, thoughts and personality onto a computer within the next ten or twenty years, according to a leading pioneer of the technology. The technology, which is similar to that seen in the film Transcendence starring Johnny Depp, is being developed by entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt. She has already created a disturbingly realistic robotic 'clone' of her wife Bina that she hopes will be a prototype for the technology. The robot apparently shares the ideas and personality of Bina by creating a database of her memories, beliefs and thoughts, along with information taken from social media interactions and blogs she shares. This allows the robot, called Bina48, to express opinions and interact in conversations like a real, living person. Mrs Rothblatt, 60, an internet radio entrepreneur who lives as a transgender woman, believes the these 'Mind Clones' could eventually be used to help provide social interactions for people living alone and even help recreate the personalities of people after they have died. 'I think helping people to confront difficult emotional challenges done in a safe environment is a positive thing,' said Dr Rizzo. 'When people avoid processing things, this is when it comes back and haunts them.' 'I don't think there is any disrespect to the dead to want to view them and interact with them,' he added.

He recalled it being colder than he had expected flying from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to DC, where the sight of the Washington Monument helped guide him to the Capitol grounds. Some of the people below waved to Hughes, who intended the flight as a protest to highlight the need for campaign-finance reform, as he flew over the National Mall.  He said: 'People were not frightened at all. 'That part of it was surreal.' Hughes hoped to raise awareness about the influence of big money in politics by deliberately breaking the law to deliver 535 letters, one for each member of Congress.  Instead, the overwhelming focus of news coverage has been about the gaps he exposed in national security. He told The Associated Press: 'We've got bigger problems in this country than worrying about whether the security around DC is ironclad. 'We need to be worried about the piles of money that are going into Congress. 'The message was two pages long to Congress that they are going to have to face the issue, OK, of campaign-finance reform and honesty and government so that they work for the people.

The ultralight aircraft and its cargo - a US Postal Service bin carrying the letters - were seized.  His Russian-born wife, Alena, told the AP that her husband acted out of patriotism for the United States. She said: 'I am very proud of my husband. He is a countryman.' Hughes faces up to four years in prison on charges of unlawfully operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national defense airspace. He will remain home until he is back in Washington for a preliminary hearing in May Asked if he too thinks he's a patriot or simply crazy, Hughes said 'everyone gets to make up their own mind about me, that's what I'd say.'

The blunder was believed to have been caused by a race marshal taking a toilet break during the event, missing 300 runners who should have been directed at a junction point. Instead they continued past the unmanned marshall point and had to run for an extra three kilometres while the other 900 competitors followed the correct route. Scroll down for video  Blunder: Charity runners taking part in yesterday's Bournemouth Bay 10K Run (pictured) were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour The bizarre gaffe happened during yesterday's Bournemouth Bay Run and today the organisers - Bournemouth Borough Council - appealed for those who were affected by the mix-up to contact them for a 'gesture of goodwill.' A local authority spokesman said that it was investigating what happened to the marshal who should have directed runners at a turning point. It was reported that some runners were 'in tears' while one described the event's organisation as 'shambolic'.  Hayley James, who is four months pregnant and from Poole, said: 'To have a race of that scale with only one marshal on a point is inexcusable. 'We saw loads of people walking at the end, some were in tears, I felt so sorry for them - I felt like crying at the 10km mark.' Andy Isaac, from Bournemouth, said the event was 'mayhem' with one point where an elderly woman managed to drive onto the route and was flashing her lights at oncoming runners.  A map shows where up to 300 runners continued along the coastal path after a marshal who was meant to direct them on to a turn went to the toilet Reaction: Two people vent their frustration at the Bournemouth Bay Run on Twitter yesterday It also emerged that water stations ran out of supplies during the race, forcing some runners to drink from half-empty bottles that had been left on the ground as they battled against dehydration. Commenting on the Daily Echo website, one runner said: \"We had a bottle of water at the three mile station, but at the six mile point they had totally ran out, so nothing. Jon Weaver, head of resort marketing and events at the council, said: 'Unfortunately there was some confusion with marshalling arrangements at one point, but it was a critical point. We apologise unreservedly to those front runners. 'In 33 years of running... this is the first time this has happened and as part of our debrief we will be analysing the arrangements carefully... to learn for 2016. 'We understand runners have trained for a long time for the event and it's hard for them and we do empathise with how they are feeling.' It was hoped that the event would have raised more than \u00a370,000 for the British Heart Foundation.  Some racers took to Twitter to vent their frustration over the blunder. Rob Kelly wrote: Really disappointed in the #BournemouthBayRun 10k that ended up 13k very poor show bad marshalling #wontbeback.' AndKim Kelly replied: 'Totally agree and never got to do a 5k as they were 45mins behind schedule :(((.'",

Jonny Bucknell, 58, was enjoying his meal in the council chamber when a Labour rival, Theo Blackwell, spotted him and alerted other councillors. He was forced to put down his cutlery when the mayor, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, interrupted the proceedings to tell him off. Taking a stand: Jonny Bucknell is no stranger to odd behaviour. In 2013 he slept in his car at the Tory party conference. He now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetings The mayor, who was chairing the meeting of Camden Council in north London, reminded the hungry councillor that eating was banned in the chamber. But the angry diner claims he was unaware eating there was forbidden and said he now aims to campaign for a rule change. The rumpus comes a month after Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Elengorn was caught playing Scrabble during a Richmond Council budget meeting in south-west London. Telling off: Mayor of Camden Council, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, had to tell Mr Bucknell to stop eating When he first noticed him eating, Mr Blackwell told his fellow councillors: 'It appears that one of our Tory colleagues is consuming a full Sunday roast dinner in the council chamber. 'Could I ask the borough solicitor to give us advice on eating a full roast dinner in the council chamber? It's a little bit more than a cheeky Snickers.' The diner was forced to curtail his meal. Mr Bucknell, who has been a councillor for more than ten years and represents Belsize, Hampstead, told the Evening Standard: 'I never knew there was a ban on eating in the chamber. 'They should definitely repeal it. There is nothing wrong with nibbling from a lunch box if you are being discreet. 'It is not as if a cold meal is going to waft around like a McDonald's. 'I will be campaigning for the repealing of the law that says you can't nibble from a lunch box in the council chamber.' The Conservative councillor said the meal, in a plastic box, had travelled home with him after a French snowboarding holiday. 'The chalet always brought out too much food and I can't stand wasting food,' he said. He previously found fame when he slept in his Volvo car to save on hotel bills during the Conservative party conference in September 2013. Mr Bucknell said at the time it was to make a stand against what he called 'ridiculous prices'. He said the economy would improve if more people were thrifty like him.  After the council meeting mayor Lazzaro Pietragnoli said: 'I understand councillors do a difficult job and sometimes don't get time to eat dinner. 'I also tend to be quite flexible, but having a big meal in front of him - that was a bit too much.' A Camden Council spokesman said: 'It is as the mayor said, standing orders say that members should not eat in the chamber.'

The screening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development. By looking for distinctive 'breath prints', researchers were also able to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease. Scroll down for video  In and out: Thanks to a breath test, researchers claim there were able to detect the early stages of stomach cancer and also to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease (stock image) Israeli researchers say the system is accurate, cheap \u2013 and allows patients to be monitored without using invasive procedures. The discovery comes as scientists in the US made a breakthrough that could lead a test to flag up the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer. A protein has been identified which seems to play a crucial role in the rapid growth of tumours. The breath test discovery is hoped to save thousands of lives. About 7,000 people develop stomach cancer in the UK each year and most of these cases are in the advanced stages when they are diagnosed. Research leader Professor Hossam Haick of the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute in Haifa, said: 'The attraction of this test lies in its non-invasiveness, ease of use, rapid predictiveness, insensitivity to confounding factors, and potentially low cost.' Breathe: The tscreening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development (stock image) Previous research has found that other methods could be used to identify stomach cancer, but none looked at detecting pre-cancerous changes. In the study published online in the journal Gut, breath samples were taken from 484 people, including 99 already diagnosed with stomach cancer. They were analysed by so-called nanomaterial sensors, which are able to read a chemical signal or pattern linked with stomach cancer based on very small particles in a patient's breath. The test is so accurate it could detect the difference between early and late stage gastric cancers. The researchers hope the breath test could be used as an alternative to endoscopies, an invasive and expensive procedure to diagnose gastric cancers using a long flexible tube.  A large trial involving thousands of patients, including those with stomach cancer or pre-cancerous changes, is currently under way in Europe to test the technology's suitability as a screening method, they add. Meanwhile, US experts say the discovery of a new biomarker protein may one day lead to a test which differentiates men with aggressive prostate cancer from those with a less threatening form of the disease. The findings, published in the scientific journal Oncogene, raises hope of tests that deliver an accurate diagnosis from the outset. The results could lead to more targeted treatment for those with the worst cancers \u2013 and less treatment for men whose tumours are not dangerous. Professor Renny Franceschi, of the University of Michigan, said it paves the way for a 'warning light' that signals how dangerous the cancer is. It might also one day lead to a treatment which stops tumours growing. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, with 40,000 diagnosed in Britain every year. Current tests only identify whether a tumour is likely to be present. But they are unreliable, holding a high risk of 'false positives' that wrongly identify healthy men as having cancer. Professor Franceschi said that if further research proves positive, eventually it might lead to a test involving a simple biopsy when the patient first complains of symptoms.",

The Ibrox boss watched his side drop two points against bottom side Livingston in West Lothian but insisted the 1-1 draw \u2014 with Myles Hippolyte and Marius Zaliukas trading goals \u2014 could end up being crucial in the quest to finish second. Rangers have only won once in their last five away matches and McCall insists nothing less than a victory will do at the Bet Butler Stadium this weekend as his side aim to go four clear in second while Hibs face Falkirk in the Scottish Cup semi finals. Stuart McCall wants his side to put their away-day blues behind them at Dumbarton on Saturday 'We could be four ahead on Saturday night so that might be a very important point for us tonight,' said McCall on a night when Rangers fans let off a series of fireworks in the Energy Assets Arena. 'It's still in our hands \u2014 but we have got to go and win on Saturday! 'Of course I'm disappointed not to win the game. We didn't deserve any more but this wasn't a case of us blowing hot and cold. We've no divine right to come here and win. 'I said before the game this would be a tough place to come. OK, we didn't play as fluently as we would have liked but Livvy were fighting for their lives. They are a physical side and Hibs and Queen of the South have still to come here. Rangers dropped two points at Championship bottom side Livingston in their bid for promotion Myles Hippolyte gave Livingston the lead early in the second half and threatened to upset Rangers 'It was a game that panned out the way I expected on a tight park, dry and bumpy. It was a fair result. You can't stop a free kick like that (by Hippolyte).' Meanwhile, Mark Burchill was left ruing a first half 'goal' by Hippolyte that was chalked off after a supposed foul by Jordan White on Cammy Bell. But the Livvy boss was also left lamenting his team's dire defending 120 seconds after taking the lead through Hippolyte's fine freekick. 'I think everyone here knows it should have been a goal by Myles in the first half,' he sighed. Marius Zaliukas equalised a couple of minutes later for Rangers at the Energy Assets Arena 'I'm just really disappointed. It was a terrible goal for us to lose. If you go ahead in a match you really want to do better than that. When you've taken the lead that's your most vulnerable time as a team. And I just feel if we had weathered that then Rangers would have run out of ideas. 'It was not the best we have played but I felt we more than matched Rangers tonight.

In December West Brom were two goals up but lost to a Charlie Austin hat-trick, leading to Barton's scathing judgement and plunging Alan Irvine to the brink of the sack. Barton said then: 'West Brom went 2-0 up and I turned to Dunney (Richard Dunne) and said, 'they've scored too early.' They don't know how to get over the finishing line.' Tony Pulis has admitted that Joey Barton 'probably had a point' about West Brom losing their cool The outspoken midfielder (right) was commenting after West Brom surrendered a two-goal lead  The teams meet again at the Hawthorns on Saturday with Pulis having instilled a solid core to the point Albion have not conceded after scoring first in a game. 'Whatever Joey says or whatever he does he's entitled to hid views and his opinions,' Pulis said. 'The club were 2-0 up and lost 3-2 so he most probably had a point, or he felt he had a point to say something on that subject.' Pulis recalled his own misfortune from leading 2-0 and losing as Gillingham manager in the Second Division play-off final of 1999. 'I've managed teams that have been 2-0 up with only for or five minutes to go and ended up drawing then losing on penalties. 1999 Man City Wembley,' he added. 'So I can't talk about being indestructible in respect to leads. 'We've played really well I don't think they've just been good results. The performances have been really, really good.

His body was wrapped in an industrial-size bin bag with duct tape round it when it appeared on a beach in nearby Orihuela Costa. Civil Guard officers in Alicante confirmed today they believe Monk, from Essex, may be implicated in the violent death and named him as an associate of Paul Scott. Scott, 32, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine after being caught trying to sneak into Britain in a light aircraft last December. He was also wanted for questioning over Mr Brennan's murder when he was detained. Guardia Civil described him last night as the suspected mastermind of the crime. Monk was detained at a four-bedroom property in Javea near Alicante as he directed workers laying a marble patio around his swimming pool. An imitation firearm with a silencer and nearly \u00a3100,000 in cash were also found. He is being held in jail and is expected to be charged and face trial in Spain over Mr Brennan's murder before being extradited to the UK to face questioning over alleged drugs offences. He has been linked to the handover of one kilo of cocaine in Cockfosters, London, in May 2013 and the seizure of 24 kilos of cannabis in Colchester in October 2013. A Civil Guard spokesman said: 'He never left his house as a security measure to avoid being arrested. 'He got other people to bring him food and other things in the villa where he hid out, leading the life of an authentic fugitive.'

He travelled to the Costa del Sol with his girlfriend towards the end of 2013 after ignoring the advice of his parents to stay in Britain.

Ambulance staff and firefighters were working to release him and were shocked to see the driver emerge from the wreckage and walk away unaided Yet as paramedics and firefighters worked to release him, they were shocked to see him emerge from the wreckage and walk away unaided.

      "src": "On the surface, the mix-up seems incomprehensible: How can a volunteer sheriff's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a Taser, killing a man? That's apparently what happened in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when a 73-year-old reserve deputy, Robert Bates, killed Eric Harris. Bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead. \"Oh! I shot him. I'm sorry,\" Bates said in a video of the shooting. But it's happened before. In a well-publicized 2009 case, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fired his gun instead of his Taser, killing 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland, California. The former officer, Johannes Mehserle, testified that he had meant to use his Taser but drew his gun instead. Mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct. So how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a Taser? Here are some factors to consider: Law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body, and the Taser should be placed on the nondominant side. So if an officer is left-handed, the gun should be on the left side. Bates' attorney said his client is left-handed. But the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side. \"I shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed,\" Bates said in a written statement to investigators. After Bates announced at the scene he was going to use his Taser, he \"used his nondominant hand, and it was the gun,\" said Clark Brewster, Bates' attorney. \"He said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder, assumed it was the Taser,\" Brewster said. \"Both the gun and the Taser have a laser sight, and he just made a mistake.\" Brewster also said his client's left hand was holding a pepper gun. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had grabbed a \"pepper ball launcher\" to try to slow or stop Harris, who was running away. Bates did not say explicitly where the Taser was on his body. But he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was \"startled\" by the recoil of the gun. \"After realizing what had happened I was in a state of shock and disbelief,\" he told investigators. Bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter. If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison. Deputy who shot Eric Harris turns himself in Bates was carrying his personal gun, a Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolver, and a Model X26 Taser, he said in his statement to investigators. Attorneys representing the Harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices. One held up a small black .357 revolver, followed by a mostly bright yellow Taser that was noticeably larger than the gun. \"There's no way an officer can get this confused with this,\" said one of the attorneys from the law firm of Smolen, Smolen & Roytman. Taser's X26 model comes in different designs. Some are mostly yellow, while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle. But all appear to be larger than Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolvers. Sgt. Jim Clark of the Tulsa Police Department -- which is separate from the county sheriff's office for which Bates volunteered -- said Bates was the \"victim\" of something called \"slip and capture.\" That's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation. But a criminal justice expert told CNN the claim amounts to \"junk science.\" \"There's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this. ... It's not generally accepted by the scientific community,\" said Phil Stinson, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University. \"So it's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence.\" An attorney for the Harris family said the \"slip and capture\" theory hasn't held up in court. \"The only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in Oakland (of Oscar Grant),\" the attorney said. And that defense failed. Tasers are built to feel and look different than guns, according to Taser International. Steve Tuttle, vice president for strategic communications at Taser, noted some of those differences to CNN: A gun is heavier. A Taser has a different grip and feel. When you take the safety off on a Taser, an LED control panel lights up. There's more: Tasers can be different colors (yellow or black), and the holster is different from a gun's. But in the field, where an officer reacts on instinct, there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important, Tuttle said. Taser's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer's nondominant side, as law enforcement experts say. And its training suggests that officers shout aloud, \"Taser! Taser! Taser!\" as they prepare to deploy it. These guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for. It is up to each law enforcement department, however, in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body. The company declined to comment on the Tulsa shooting in particular. The stun guns, or conducted electrical weapons, manufactured by Taser have been used more than 2.7 million times, Tuttle said, and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Brooke Baldwin, Ed Lavandera and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.",

Their concern about Wilshere, 23, who has over two years left on his Arsenal deal, is his injury record. He has yet to return to Arsene Wenger's side since having surgery on his troublesome left ankle in November. There is a well-trodden path between Arsenal and City over the past five years.  The Manchester club, who offer far bigger salaries, have spent \u00a380million on Samir Nasri, Bacary Sagna, Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy. Frank Lampard was among the few English representatives for Manchester City at Selhurst Park Joe Hart (centre) was the only England player that started while James Milner (right) came on as a sub Wilshere played 90 minutes for Arsenal as he stepped up in his return from injury at the Emirates Henderson clears the ball during Liverpool's defeat by Arsenal at the Emirates in the Premier League And City will certainly need to make bids in excess of \u00a330m to tempt Arsenal or Liverpool to sell. Not all of City's targets will be English, though, with the club willing to use France star Nasri and Bosnia forward Edin Dzeko as bait in a deal to sign Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. Pogba, a 22-year-old France international, was on Manchester United's books before moving to Italy. City see him as the long-term successor to the fading Yaya Toure, although Pogba could cost as much as \u00a360m. Nasri and Dzeko have had poor seasons and are expected to be part of a summer cull.

Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy. Batschelet warns that current trends mean as many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Scroll down for video  As many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy 'The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,' he told CNN. 'We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50 percent, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army. It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.' Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country in 2014, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, too many tattoos or a lack of education - but 10 percent didn't qualify because they were overweight.  According to the CDC, 81 percent of overweight boys and 71 percent of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. Army recruiters, facing overweight prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up, have become fitness coaches - much like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser. Boot camp: The maximum body fat percentage that the army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females The recruiters will spend time educating the hopefuls on diet and exercise and encourage them to lose the pounds necessary to qualify for boot camp.  Many still fail to make the grade, but some do - such as a female recruit from Kansas who lost 80 pounds in a year so that she could sign up. 'We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,' said Batschelet. 'We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.' The maximum body fat percentage that the Army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females.   The maximum a female soldier, aged 17-20, can weigh is 227 pounds, while the maximum for a male soldier in the same age group is 234 pounds and in both instances that is dependent on being 80 inches tall. Obesity rates have tripled in a generation with more than one-third of U.S. adults now considered obese, while 17 percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese.  Army recruiters are having to act like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser (ex-trainer Jillian Michaels pictured above) when they met prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up but are too fat to fight",

This season, like so many in recent years, has been a frustrating one at St James' Park and that has led some fans to take action when Spurs arrive on Sunday. A number of supporters plan to boycott the televised game in protest against owner Mike Ashley, which is likely to lead to a peculiar atmosphere in the north east. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino (right) is in an upbeat mood ahead of the trip to Newcastle Newcastle fans are staging a mass protest against the current regime at St James' Park It will certainly make it an interesting test for Pochettino's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own. 'You never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive,' the Spurs boss said. 'Maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season. 'Or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and don't show their face. 'You never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team. For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday.' On paper, this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa. Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs' season in danger of fizzling out The fact Pochettino's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter's victory made it all the more frustrating, yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James' Park. 'I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player, manager and head coach,' he said. 'I accept in football there are good and bad moments, but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood. 'We always want to win and we are ambitious, but always we need to have a very good mood. 'We need to have patience, we need to work hard, we have to have our minds on the players and we need to have very good energy to repeat some of the performances this season.'

Former Argentina international Jonas Gutierrez's recovery following a battle with cancer and his return to top-flight football has inspired many. 'I am very happy for him,' Pochettino said. 'When he went in the game against Liverpool, he got a good ovation and it was good to see him playing football. 'This is real life.

Facinet Keita, 31, fled the Olympic village in summer 2012, claiming his failure to win a medal meant he 'would be murdered' if he returned to his native Guinea. His wife who was left to look after the couple's two children has now split from him because she 'couldn't wait for him'. Mr Keita \u2013 the official flag-bearer for the West African nation during the opening ceremony \u2013 said he decided to go on the run after losing to an opponent from the Pacific island of Guam within five minutes.  He said: 'My coaches told me I had lost the fight like a baby. They said I embarrassed my country and I would be in big trouble when we are at home.' After three months sleeping rough, Mr Keita handed himself in to authorities and was locked up in an immigration detention centre. While there he made two requests for asylum, both of which were rejected. After the second failed request, he was told he had to leave Britain on December 17, 2013. He agreed to board a plane to Ghana, but upon arrival there he said that he was turned back because he did not have the correct travel documents. He returned to Britain and was once again detained.  However, he was released in March 2014 and has since been coaching judo in Stoke-on-Trent. He now plans to make a third application for asylum. Mr Keita said he has built a new life in Britain and has met friends who have become like family. 'The people here are really welcoming, if you show them you are a good person,' he added.

Mr Keita denies he has stayed in Britain to claim benefits. He said: 'My situation is difficult, 100 per cent difficult. I want to be near my family and I want to see them but I can't.' His request to stay in Britain has been backed by the African Social Health Agency, which supports asylum seekers. It described Mr Keita as an asset to the local community. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We do not routinely comment on individual cases. 'The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and we consider every claim on its individual merits.

Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become. Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid.  Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United Bale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters Bale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final He said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.' Real Madrid's \u00a386million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify.  His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season. Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side. Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes The possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid. In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid. He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time. Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey The former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season He wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps. At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest. In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate. Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend.  Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas De Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea De Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain. He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2. Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable. De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for \u00a318million All that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real. The supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain. But they don't believe it will be necessary. They see both men lining-up for them next season. Bale's desire to stay in Spain will keep him at Madrid. It only remains to be seen just how much De Gea wants to join him in the Spanish capital.",

      "src": "The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is one of the icons of the Cold War - a self-contained and sufficient town buried under the Rockies meant to be impervious to a Soviet nuclear barrage. It was home to the North American Aerospace Command (NORAD), scanning the skies for Russian missiles and the military command and control center of the United States in the event of World War Three. The high tech base entered popular culture with appearances in the 1983 Cold War thriller War Games and 1994's Stargate - which imagined the complex as a clandestine home for intergalactic travel. Scroll down for video  Secret: The Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado was built for NORAD to direct the American response to a nuclear war with the USSR during the Cold War Protection: There are 15 three story building inside the military complex and each is buffered by a 25-ton blast door Small town: The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is home to more than 1,000 personnel and is able to operate as an underground town for months with fresh water and food It shut down nearly ten years ago as the threat from Russia seemed to subside, but this week the Pentagon announced that Cheyenne Mountain will once again be home to the most advanced tracking and communications equipment in the United States military. The shift to the Cheyenne Mountain base in Colorado is designed to safeguard the command's sensitive sensors and servers from a potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, military officers said. The Pentagon last week announced a $700 million contract with Raytheon Corporation to oversee the work for North American Aerospace Command (NORAD) and US Northern Command. Admiral William Gortney, head of NORAD and Northern Command, said that 'because of the very nature of the way that Cheyenne Mountain's built, it's EMP-hardened.' Power: At its height Cheyenne was home to NORAD who watched 7,000 aircraft per day as part of their surveillance operations Headquarters: The US and Canadian military jointly operated NORAD from within Cheyenne and soldiers from north of the border made up 15 percent of the personnel at the base Around-the-clock crews monitor U.S. skies from the command center of the Northern Command  located deep within Cheyenne Mountain at the foot of the Rocky Mountains near Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2002 'And so, there's a lot of movement to put capability into Cheyenne Mountain and to be able to communicate in there,' Gortney told reporters. 'My primary concern was... are we going to have the space inside the mountain for everybody who wants to move in there, and I'm not at liberty to discuss who's moving in there,' he said. The Cheyenne mountain bunker is a half-acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack. From inside the massive complex, airmen were poised to send warnings that could trigger the launch of nuclear missiles. But in 2006, officials decided to move the headquarters of NORAD and US Northern Command from Cheyenne to Petersen Air Force base in Colorado Springs. The Cheyenne bunker was designated as an alternative command center if needed. Almost 10 years ago, the military closed the secretive defense complex carved into Cheyenne Mountain that for decades monitored American skies for threats. The North American Aerospace Defense Command operations center was moved to nearby Peterson Air Force Base, which is home to the U.S. Northern Command created after the Sept. 11 attacks. Cheyenne Mountain Complex is 2,000 feet below the granite rocks and made up of 15 three-story buildings protected from nuclear blasts and seismic movement by a system of 1,000 giant springs. The entire complex is designed to withstand a direct hit by a 30 megaton nuclear explosion and has 25-ton blast doors surrounding the complex. NORAD, a joint U.S. and Canadian command, was set up in the 1960s to monitor the skies for threats like missiles, aircraft and space objects. In 2006, Adm. Tim Keating, who commanded both NORAD and the U.S. Northern Command, said the government's best intelligence 'led them to believe a missile attack from China or Russia was very unlikely.' Cold War heroes: The Cheyenne mountain bunker is a half-acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack That, along with the emergence of varied terrorist threats such as suicide bombers, 'was why we recommended that we don't need to maintain Cheyenne Mountain in a 24/7 status. We can put it on `warm standby,' said Keating. About 1,100 people work in the mountain, long a symbol of the Cold War. Buildings inside it are mounted on springs to absorb the shock from a nuclear blast, while the entrance is guarded by a vault-like door several feet thick. The complex includes banks of batteries and its own water supply. Excavation on the site began in 1961. Canadian crews stationed at Cheyenne Mountain will also made the move to Peterson, Keating said. Hollywood: Sci-fi movie Stargate (1994) was set inside the Cheyenne Mountain Complex while 1983's War Games also imagine a nuclear standoff operated from inside the nuclear bunker That move was touted a more efficient use of resources but had followed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of modernization work at Cheyenne carried out after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Now the Pentagon is looking at shifting communications gear to the Cheyenne bunker, officials said. 'A lot of the back office communications is being moved there,' said one defense official. Officials said the military's dependence on computer networks and digital communications makes it much more vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse, which can occur naturally or result from a high-altitude nuclear explosion. Under the 10-year contract, Raytheon is supposed to deliver 'sustainment' services to help the military perform 'accurate, timely and unambiguous warning and attack assessment of air, missile and space threats' at the Cheyenne and Petersen bases. Raytheon's contract also involves unspecified work at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.",

      "src": "David Crossley developed large kidney stones Like many busy people, David Crossley often used to find himself so wrapped up in his working day that he would go without lunch, and often barely stopped for a cup of tea. In fact, David, 63, a musculoskeletal therapist from Birmingham, admits: 'I would often be so busy at the clinic that I'd forget to drink any liquid at all, other than the odd cup of tea or coffee. It had been the same way for years - although I would drink more water at weekends.' Last year, this habit caught up with him. He noticed a vague ache in his abdomen, stretching around to his back. 'It wasn't agonising but it just didn't feel quite right, so I went to the GP,' he says. 'As I had some bloating, he sent me for an ultrasound.' This revealed two large stones in his right kidney - a direct result, his doctors believe, of his low fluid intake. A CT scan showed that the stones were so large (6 mm across) they could not be passed naturally, and he needed surgery. One in ten of us will develop a kidney stone, and the numbers are rising dramatically. They are the result of waste products in the blood forming crystals inside the kidneys, which eventually build up into a solid lump. They can be excruciatingly painful - on a level, say experts, with childbirth. The stones often remain symptomless while they're in the kidney. They start causing pain - known as renal colic - once they travel down the ureter, the narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. 'Renal colic is caused by the stone suddenly blocking the ureter,' says Mr Leye Ajayi, consultant urological surgeon at the Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth, London. The pain often comes on suddenly and can cause the patient to 'writhe around in agony', he adds. The pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomiting. Once on the move, a stone can take days or weeks to travel out of the body. In that time, it may cause persistent or intermittent pain in the back, groin or side, a need to urinate more than usual, and pain when urinating. Sometimes, if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney, it can lead to a build-up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection. Signs of this include a fever, shivering, extreme weakness, diarrhoea, or cloudy and bad-smelling urine. The bad news is that the number of people developing troublesome stones is rocketing. Emergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent, according to official figures, rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year. Meanwhile, the number of people going in for planned non-emergency treatment for stones has almost doubled in the same period, rising from 26,666 in 2004 to 51,340.  The cause for his condition, doctors believe, was low fluid intake And bizarrely, it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym, and then not drinking enough, or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame, and may be why cases are going up, especially among women. 'More men than women used to suffer from kidney stones, with a ratio of about three to one,' says Mr Ajayi. 'But an increasing number of women now get them, and the ratio is evening up.' The main cause of kidney stones is dehydration. 'Your kidneys are your waste-disposal system,' explains Dr Kathryn Griffith, the Royal College of GPs' clinical champion for kidney care. 'They discard all the waste chemicals produced by your body, and they can do this efficiently if enough liquid is drunk to help flush them through. 'But if you become dehydrated, you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone-forming chemicals, and these begin to bind together to build stones.' To avoid this, you need to drink enough to ensure your urine is 'the colour of white wine', says Dr Griffith - around 1.2 litres a day. You need more during hot weather or after exercise. Changing diet trends are also pushing the figures up. 'There has been a trend, especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle, to eat low-carb, high-protein diets,' says Dr Griffith. 'The animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid (a known stone-former) in your urine. They also reduce the amount of citrate (a stone-inhibitor). 'This can lead to uric acid stones forming, especially if you also don't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job.' There are other causes, too. Your kidneys remove sodium, which is the main component of salt, from your body. When they do this, they excrete calcium, too. But low-carb diets could also put you at risk So the more salt you eat, the more calcium you will have in your urine, which can build into stones. Obesity is another risk factor. 'Obese people are more likely to have insulin resistance (where the body can't use insulin effectively),' says Mr Ajayi. This causes a change to the nature of urine, making it more acidic, which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney. Eating excessive amounts of oxalate is another culprit, as it can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones - the most common kind. Oxalate-rich foods include tea, spinach, rhubarb, nuts, strawberries, beetroot and chocolate. They are all fine in moderation, but avoid large daily quantities. If you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time, you should ask your GP for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones, which are caused by a build-up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections, adds Dr Griffith. Virtually all stones under 5 mm in diameter can be passed naturally, with only prescription-strength pain relief and medication that relaxes the ureter needed while this happens, says Mr Ajayi. But if a stone is bigger, you may need to have treatment. The most common is extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This involves sending shock-waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone. 'This works for stones up to about 10 mm in diameter, but not for bigger ones, or for stones that are very hard,' says Mr Ajayi. 'It's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity, as the shock-waves have further to go to reach the stone.' For bigger or harder stones, a ureteroscopy is performed. Under general anaesthetic, a thin scope is passed up your urethra and a laser is used to break up the stone. For very large stones (those over 15 mm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is used. A nephroscope - a telescope-like device - is inserted through a small incision in your back. The stone is broken up using a combination of high-frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy (a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road). David Crossley had a ureteroscopy at the BMI Priory Hospital, Birmingham, in September. 'I was out the day after my surgery, and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days, thankfully I'm now stone-free.' He knows that a person who has had a stone has a 50 per cent chance of developing them again within five years unless they make changes to their lifestyle. 'The lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place: proper hydration, low-salt, staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein,' says Mr Ajayi. The British Association of Urological Surgeons advises that we should be aiming for no more than four of the following protein portions a day, two of which should be dairy to ensure you have enough calcium: 50-75 g of red meat, chicken or fish; two eggs; \u00bd pint of milk; 50g cheese; a small pot of yogurt. Mr Ajayi also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily, as the citrate (a form of acetic acid) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances, such as oxalates, that lead to stones. Today, David ensures that he gets enough fluid. 'I didn't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones,' he says. 'I now drink water religiously!'",

      "src": "A group of disabled Manchester City supporters say they are 'disgusted' with the club after they hiked prices of some season tickets by \u00a3345 to \u00a3975. The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from \u00a3870 to \u00a31,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from \u00a3870 to \u00a31,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay \u00a3345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost \u00a3975. 'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.' The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next season Mark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal. 'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area. 'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.' City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.",

According to the ABC, the key is to maintain an even balance of 'energy in' and 'energy out.'   This means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight.  A small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work off Indulging in two hot cross buns (without jam and butter) will take up to 50 minutes of running to work off It may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of Easter treats.  For four solid mini chocolate Easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules.  A female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes, whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes.  One medium chocolate bunny takes two and a half to three hours of kayaking with women needing to paddle for half an hour longer than men to work it off. The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out' and balancing food and fitness Experts are advising that it is better to manage our energy consumption than to try and work it off afterward Two hot cross buns takes up to 50 minutes running and if you have lathered it with butter and jam, it would take 80 minutes of running. Exercise physiologist Alex Lawrence from Exercise Sport Science Australia has said that many Australians still struggle to maintain a healthy weight as most do not realise how many kilojoules are in the foods we consume. 'It's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption, than to try and work off the energy after you've taken it in,' he said. Lawrence is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat. He advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eating part of your lifestyle so that you can indulge in treats every now and then. 'What we're trying to encourage people to do is make better lifestyle choices; to eat treat foods in moderation and to make sure they are physically active most of the time. That way when holidays, like Easter, come around they don't have to feel like they have to deny themselves,' he said.",

The 28-year-old, who is on loan to Everton, was reportedly interviewed by officers under caution over the alleged assault earlier this month. A teenage waitress claims England footballer Aaron Lennon (pictured playing for Everton) grabbed her, slapped her and ripped her top  After taking part in Everton's 1-0 win at home against Southampton on April 4, Lennon is thought to have headed to Suede nightclub in Manchester with friends.  Lennon, who has 21 England caps, lives in a penthouse apartment in the city centre.  That night, the venue, which is popular with Premier League footballers, was packed with hundreds who had come to see singer Trey Songz perform. But later in the evening, the waitress claimed to have been attacked by the player in the VIP section - where booths cost \u00a32,000. She was interviewed by Greater Manchester Police four days later.  A source told The Sun's Michael Hamilton and Dean Wilkins that the girl, who is 'very pretty', had worked at the club for just under a year.

On the night of April 4, singer Trey Songz (right) performed at the venue  'She got really upset, left what she was doing and rushed to the toilet,' the source said. 'She came out about an hour later and was annoyed security had not done anything and kicked Lennon out.  'She says he grabbed her and ripped her top and then slapped her.'  On April 15, the day before Lennon's 28th birthday, he was interviewed by police officers on suspicion of assault. Police confirmed no arrests were made and an investigation is ongoing.  A Greater Manchester Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'On Wednesday 8 April 2015, police were called following reports an 18-year old woman had been assaulted at Suede night club, Longworth Street, Manchester city centre on Sunday 5 April 2015.

Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man vs PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the third in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I look back on one of the most anticipated events of the 20th century which divided a nation.  THE SECOND FIGHT OF THE CENTURY Joe Frazier v Muhammad Ali Madison Square Garden, New York March 8, 1971 The Greatest had been stripped of the world heavyweight title he had won so sensationally against Sonny Liston but it was the reason for that decision which added cultural significance to what was to be a magnificent fight.  Sweat sprays off Muhammad Ali (right) as Joe Frazier collects his jaw with a strong left in 1971 Ali and Frazier at Madison Square Garden, New York, on March 8, 1971, was the second 'Fight of the Century' Ali's evasive abilities and speed, such as this swerve from a Frazier hook, kept him in the fight Smokin' Joe was the undefeated two-belt champion but it was this proud black man's bizarre adoption by America's conservative right which stoked the fires of society still further. Muhammad Ali had been banned from boxing for three-and-a-half years for refusing induction into the US military to fight in Vietnam \u2013 but as a consequence become the darling of the young, the black and the Civil Rights movement. Joe Frazier found himself unwittingly the standard bearer for the white establishment.  Ali fanned the flames by labelling the simpler man who would become his arch-rival an 'Uncle Tom,' the most wounding insult for an African American There was a foretaste of the current scramble for Mayweather-Pacquaio tickets. Woody Allen was one of the very few celebrities give a complimentary seat and other famous names had to work their way into the 20,000 crowd at the Garden. Frank Sinatra persuaded Life magazine to give him a camera and send him as their ringside photographer.  Fast-talking Ali offensively labelled Frazier an 'Uncle Tom' due to the support he got from white conservatives  Referee Tony Perez, widely believed to have acted leniently in Ali's favour, orders the pair to their corners JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York  Author Norman Mailer reported on the fight. Actor Burt Lancaster picked up a TV microphone for his only stint as a colour commentator. Artist Leroy Neiman sat at his easel painting Ali and Frazier as they fought. This was one fight in which the action fully lived up to the hype and its place in history. Ali came out fast to dominate the first three rounds. Frazier, encouraged by catching Ali with the last punch of the third, launched an attack to the body in the fourth which brought him into the ascendancy.  Ali's speed of hand, dancing feet and combination punching kept him in a fight in which he was taking increasing punishment \u2013 along with a little help from referee Arthur Mercante who declined to call a knock down when Frazier sent him crashing in the eighth.  Ali is laid out on the canvas as Frazier is send to the corner before a long 10-count in the 15th round  Somehow, heroically, survived the especially torrid 11th and 14th rounds. Still some good judges had it close going into the 15th and last round. There all argument was ended. Frazier caught him with the most wicked of all those trademark left hooks and this time there was no denying a count which appeared to edge a fraction longer than the stipulated ten seconds.  Ali rose to his feet. Unsteadily. His jaw grotesquely swollen. Again his courage carried him to the bell. The decision was unanimously in favour of Frazier, although both men went to hospital. Frazier got the unanimous decision from the judges but both men went to hospital after the epic bout Very late that night word spread through New York's animated bars that one of them had died. Frazier checked out early, quietly. Ali pronounced the rumours of his passing to be premature. Their trilogy was born. They were to fight twice more and on one of those occasions each would come close to death again.",

      "src": "Police are using tiny plastic Lego figures in a campaign to warn people about the rising tide of housebreakings in Scotland. Officers from Police Scotland's Edinburgh division \u2013 which has seen break-ins soar by nearly 40 per cent \u2013 posted pictures of the Lego models on their Facebook page as part of a move to raise awareness of crime. Last night, victims branded the move as 'insensitive' and 'a joke'.  Hands up: Plastic Lego figures are being used by police as part of a quirky campaign to warn people about the dangers of housebreaking. But the move received a backlash, with victims branding it as 'a joke' The police internet posting showed scenes of Lego criminals attempting to break into people's homes before being arrested by officers \u2013 and were accompanied by a Scots dialect poem giving advice. But the publicity stunt was met with criticism from politicians and victims who said officers should concentrate on solving real crimes. Break-ins in Edinburgh rose by 38.7 per cent in the 12 months to April 2014, with 4,101 homes hit. Across Scotland, housebreakings rose 4 per cent to 22,272 over the same period. The row will fuel concerns over the number of officers spending their days in police stations, rather than pounding the beat. Last year, critics claimed many officers were having to 'backfill' \u2013 being taken off beat duties to carry out office jobs previously covered by civilian workers. Be vigilant: The Lego figures are arranged into scenes with robbers and police officers to provide safety tips and highlight the importance of securing people's homes. Last night Police Scotland defended the campaign Last night, Police Scotland defended the campaign, pointing out that the photos have been viewed almost 350,000 times. But Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: 'With housebreaking on the increase, officers should be out solving real crimes, rather than relying on Lego to try and prevent it.' The pictures are part of an anti-housebreaking drive, Operation RAC. They were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling the city's housebreaking problem. One image shows a Lego figurine in a hat and standing beside a door. Another shows a man standing on a ledge with another figure below. Poems were posted alongside the pictures, with one reading: 'Staying in or goin oot? Lock the windaes 'n' front door. A simple step maybe, that'll prevent access tae them on the chore.' 'Keep yer hame safe when yer oot on the go, By usin' timers on lights 'n' even the radio, Timers are cheap 'n' it takes seconds tae do, And it cuid prevent ye fae calling the boys in blue.' 'Look how ye get access tae the back o' yer hame, If it's easy others wull dae the same, Restrict access tae the rear, And help prevent others fae choring yer gear.' One victim of housebreaking, Tamara Swanson from Newhaven, Edinburgh, was not impressed. The 20-year-old was alone in her home last July when an intruder attacked her as she was getting out of the shower. The man grabbed her from behind, punched her and then tried to strangle her before she managed to escape. Speaking last night, she said police had done little to help her since the incident. 'We had to keep phoning them [Police Scotland],' she said. 'I'm still going to a psychiatrist and they're putting a lot of anxiety down to this. I wasn't sleeping for months. I didn't feel safe at all.' Speaking about the online campaign, she said: 'They're [people online] not going to look at it and think, \"That's interesting\" and do anything about it.' Her father, Peter Swanson, added: 'Why would they bother doing that? Lego? It's a joke. Police Scotland is a waste of time. 'It's a money-saving thing, obviously to the detriment of policing. The cartoons are stupid. Get the guys back on the street.' Another housebreaking victim, Michael Wright said the pictures were 'terrible' and 'insensitive'. His house in the Inch area of Edinburgh was broken into just before Christmas, with thieves taking money he had set aside for presents, as well as his Ford Fiesta. Mr Wright, whose young son was at home sleeping at the time of the incident, said: 'Could they not have used the resources elsewhere, rather than reconstructing scenes of burglaries with Lego sets? 'When I saw that, I thought it was just insensitive to the victims of burglaries. They have nothing better to be doing than sitting behind their computer on Facebook.' Watch out: The campaign was shared on social media with fun poems. Pictures were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling Edinburgh's housebreaking problem He added: 'Most of the people who are being targeted are older folks in their 80s. They don't have Facebook or social media, so how are they supposed to get the message?' Chief Supt Mark Williams, Edinburgh divisional commander, said: 'Over 354,000 people have already seen this campaign on social media giving us significant reach for crime prevention messages. 'Social media is an important tool for communicating with the public. It allows us to provide vital information on crime prevention and advice on keeping safe.'",

And now the firm has announced it is cutting his pay. In his prime: GoPro creator Nick Woodman, 39, is set to be named America's highest-paid CEO of 2014  Woodman's product - a camera which can be fixed to helmets, the body, or a hand-held pole - made waves in when it debuted in 2006.  They are used by professionals and hobbyists conquering six-foot waves, treacherous ski slopes, scrappy dirt track races and bungee jumps. The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife Jill giving birth to one of their sons.  The Californian surfing couple have come a long way since the business was founded in 2004 with one product: a waterproof film camera. Before sales took off, Woodman posed as the model for their self-made adverts. But his posing days didn't last long. In 2006, the firm launched its first digital camera. Three years later it began selling a high-definition camera. The cameras are light, small and waterproof. They have other uses besides sports. TV producers use them to film in areas where big professional cameras can't go. Since launching its high-definition camera in 2009, it has sold 8.5 million of them, including 3.8 million in 2013. Its cameras are sold in more than 25,000 stores and cost between $200 and $400.  The day the company first went public, they sold 3.6 million shares of GoPro stock to rake in an astounding $86 million before taxes.

But his posing days didn't last long Woodman's shares were worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at the IPO price.

The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife giving birth to one of their sons. They are WiFi capable, typically come with remotes for control and have a capacity of 64GB currently. They are also versatile thanks to numerous add-ons, including LCD screens, and the most expensive model is $400.  Woodman's father, Dean, has also found himself an overnight millionaire. The elder Woodman loaned his son $200,000 to help get GoPro off the ground. Dean Woodman - who sold none of his shares at the IPO - now owns $280 million in GoPro shares. As Forbes notes, that is a 140,000 percent return on his initial $200,000 investment.   Its list of competitors is short, but growing. Consumer electronics companies Garmin, Samsung and Sony have all entered the market. GoPro had the best-selling camcorder in 2013, according to government paperwork filed by the company. It also sells accessories such as cases, battery packs and mounts that help users attach their cameras to surfboards, helmets or their wrists. It also has a free app and software that lets users edit, store and publish their videos to their social media accounts including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. Additional growth may come from the wild videos its cameras create, which the company hopes to use to create a media company.

      "src": "The UK's top prosecutor today told critics deriding her decision not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged child sex offences to challenge her in court. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge because she is convinced the Labour peer is not fit to plead because of his dementia. And in her first interview since she announced Lord Janner would not face trial she refused to quit because 'making the right decision is not a resigning issue'.  Fighting back: Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge over her decision not to charge Lord Janner and said she would not quit Victims and leading politicians have accused her of 'damaging public confidence' in the justice system with her ruling \u2013 even though there was a enough evidence to go ahead with a prosecution.  Mrs Saunders admitted herself that three investigations into claims made by 25 alleged victims over 25 years were botched  - but decided it was now too late to charge him. She told the Evening Standard today: 'If somebody wants to challenge my decision I'm not afraid. The proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review. 'I'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up. I thought long and hard before making it and I'm confident I got it right. My job is not to be populist.  'The medical evidence was very clear. He wouldn't be fit to stand trial, he wouldn't understand the questions, he wouldn't understand the process, he wouldn't be able to understand instructions.  'It's not to make decisions on the basis of what people want. It's about making the right decisions. Sometimes that means it won't be popular but if I'm fulfilling my duties as DPP that's the right thing to do.' Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trial Last night it emerged Mrs Saunders overruled the advice of two of the country's most senior barristers to allow Lord Janner to avoid a trial. Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. In particular, Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and corroborating accounts by victims during the two-year police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his Alzheimer's disease. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a 'trial of the facts' could have satisfied the need to get to the bottom of the appalling claims against the peer, whatever his mental state.  And MailOnline revealed last week that 19 dementia sufferers have been prosecuted for child sex offences and ten were in the past year. The Mail revealed today that Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him, it can be revealed. The move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the Labour peer for compensation. The flat, in an exclusive gated community near Hampstead Heath, North London, was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in March last year - the same month police raided Janner's Westminster office and three months after they had swooped on his home. In the four years after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009, the former Labour MP, 86, has claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances. Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raid Even earlier this month, on April 9, he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the House of Lords. A week later, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Janner would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from Alzheimer's that he could not even understand any charges against him, let alone answer them. This was despite the fact the CPS ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. Victims have accused bungling authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice. Child protection campaigners, MPs, police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said concerns over the decision were justified. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something 'very strange' about the ruling and Health Minister Norman Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of dementia sufferers being brought to trial. He added that the matter should be brought before a court because Mrs Saunders and the Crown Prosecution Service had made 'heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so'. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, when he was last seen in public Signed: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons Mr Hunt said London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been 'right' to express concern at the decision, adding: 'I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious.' Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and legal expert, said although there was strong evidence Lord Janner had dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. This week, leading politicians from seven parties demanded the decision be reversed. The group, led by Labour's Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times: 'As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.' A CPS spokesman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and that Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an 'ancillary matter'. At least ten men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010. Clare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial",

Furious Tracey Taylor, 34, caused more than \u00a313,000 worth of damage to the luxury cars including scratching the paintwork with a key and smashing the BMW's windscreen with a rock. Earlier that day she had attacked her former lover and his girlfriend, punching him on the ear and pulling her hair after barging her way into her home in Ratby, Leics. Then two days later she returned to the property and broke in through the front door, pushing her way past her love rival's 19-year-old student daughter before tearing a flatscreen TV off the wall and hurling a vase of roses across the room. When arrested she told the police she'd attacked the cars on February 18 this year because she saw they had a Porsche and a BMW between them when he'd left her 'penniless.'  Leicester Crown Court heard how Taylor had been struggling to come to terms with the breakdown of the 20 year relationship with the father of her two daughters, aged 12 and four, and a 15-year-old son.  Recorder Mark Hill QC, sentencing, told Taylor, of Desford, Leics: 'You were unable to control your temper and your appalling behaviour brings discredit upon you. 'You displayed a high level of anger and violence, carried out in the presence of two young children, causing extensive and serious damage.' Lynsey Knott, defending, said: 'It was a life-long relationship since she was 15. 'She's a devoted mother, has no previous convictions, and is ashamed two of her children were present. 'She'd assisted her partner with the running of the businesses and after the breakdown was left without a home, whilst waiting for a housing association property. Taylor received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement 'She was at rock-bottom and is truly sorry. Her doctor has increased her anti-depressant medication.' The court heard \u00a39,800 pounds' worth of damage was caused to the Porsche and \u00a33,800 to the BMW - including key scratch marks.  Florist Taylor admitted burglary, criminal damage and two counts of common assault. She received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement. She was also handed a five-year restraining order was made, banning her from contacting her ex-lover's new partner or her teenage daughter. Taylor's ex-partner, aged 40, who runs a car business, asked not to be named, but said after the case: 'It's been the most stressful year of my life, since we broke up. 'It's been a complete nightmare with all the damage, threats, outbursts and driving at me before crashing into the cars in front of our daughters. 'I can't forgive what she's done and I've split up with my girlfriend, because she couldn't cope with what's happened. 'I hope this case brings an end to the problems and we can move on and work at remaining amicable for the children.'",

Tom Ryan, 40, was struck by a Toyota while making deliveries on Staten Island, leaving the hanging by a thread. Onlookers used a shirt as a tourniquet in a desperate attempt to stop the bleeding. Witness Moe Sattar, a mechanic at the tyre store on Hylan Boulevard, said: 'Tom was screaming. 'One of his legs was laying next to him under the truck. Then he got quiet when he was bleeding out.' Mr Ryan, a married father-of-two, was taken to Staten Island University before being transferred by air ambulance to the trauma unit at Belleview hospital, FDNY sources told the New York Post. He has lost one leg, but is expected to live, a UPS representative said. The driver of the Toyota, which had North Carolina licence plates, told officers he swerved to avoid a pedestrian, according to law enforcement sources. Mr Sattar backed up this account, adding that the driver was believed to be a teenager. The NYPD said no charges were filed against the driver. He said the jaywalker stopped to rubberneck but left before emergency services reached the scene. According to Mr Ryan's Facebook page, his son, Malachy, believed to be aged eight or nine, was hit by a bus around four years ago while walking home from school. Malachy was a 'bloody mess' and needed a neck brace, but doctors said 'he would be OK', he wrote.

      "src": "A new vaccine to stimulate the body's immune system could offer a cure for HIV. The 'kick and kill' strategy aims to eradicate the virus, by stimulating the immune system - the body's natural defence mechanism - with a vaccine. Researchers believe the injection could flush out dormant HIV hiding in white blood cells with a chemical 'kick', allowing a boosted immune system to identify and kill the cells. The theory, developed by researchers at University College London, the University of Oxford and the University of North Carolina, is based on a single patient case study. Scientists hope a new 'kick and kill' vaccine could flush out HIV hidden in the body before stimulating a person's own immune system to kill the cells  'Our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails,' study co-author Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said. 'We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, as we still need to develop and test effective vaccines, but this study takes us one step closer by showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce.'  The study looked at a single 59-year-old man in London who was an 'elite controller' - meaning his immune system could control HIV for a long period of time without his needing treatment. Elite controllers, who make up 0.3 per cent of HIV patients, eventually require treatment to prevent progression to AIDS. But they can go a lot longer without treatment because their immune systems are more active against HIV.   The patient in the study had both HIV and myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow.  The bone marrow produces white blood cells, including those that help to control HIV. Pioneering new treatments for HIV, flu, ebola and cancer are being developed by scientists harnessing man-made DNA. Experts have discovered how to create strands of artificial DNA, each mimicking a different killer disease, and inject them into patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will then be able to recognise the threats and eliminate them. Inovio, one of the companies behind the technique, has begun trials in humans, after strong results in the lab. The American company is using the method to attack flu, ebola and certain types of cancer \u2013 as well as HIV and hepatitis. Experts have already started trials on female patients to see if they can stop them developing cervical cancer.  To treat the patient's myeloma, his bone marrow was completely removed and replaced using his own stem cells.  When the bone marrow was removed, the immune system was severely impaired, allowing the HIV to re-activate and replicate.  This caused the level of virus in his bloodstream to rise from fewer than 50 copies per millilitre to approximately 28,000 copies per ml before is immune system's function returned. When the patient's immune function returned about two weeks after the transplant, the levels of HIV in his bloodstream rapidly fell.  His immune system reduced HIV levels at a similar rate to the most powerful treatments available, bringing them back down to 50 copies per ml within six weeks. Professor Deenan Pillay, also of UCL, said: 'By measuring the strength of the immune system required to keep this virus under control in this rare individual, we have a better idea of the requirements for successful future treatment.  'We also managed to identify the specific immune cells that fought the infection.  'This is a single patient study, but nevertheless it is often the unusual patients who help us to understand the HIV disease process.' The man was not given any anti-HIV drugs, due to concerns about side-effects affecting his cancer treatment. The researchers noted it is possible that an equally strong immune response in combination with powerful drugs could have cured the HIV completely, however they state that is far from certain.   Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said: 'Our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails. We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, but this study takes us one step closer, showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce' 'We need to be cautious in interpreting observations from a single subject,' said Dr Nilu Goonetilleke, who began working on the study at the University of Oxford and is now at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  'However, demonstration even from a single subject, that our immune system can rapidly control HIV-1 tells us a lot about the types of immune responses we should target and augment through vaccination.' Dr Gupta adds: 'Drugs to stimulate reactivation of dormant HIV are still imperfect, and we do not know if they would be able to flush out all of the HIV from the body.  'Likewise, it remains to be seen whether a vaccine could enable a normal HIV patient's immune system to kill HIV with the full strength of an elite controller.  'Our study is a proof of principle and the results are promising, but it is unlikely to lead to a cure for at least a decade.' The study was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.",

The London Mayor praised the Coalition for having kept down unemployment and not returning to the dole queues of 1980s Britain. He said the fact that more jobs were being created was 'one of the absolute moral triumphs' of the government. Boris Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, has set out his vision of 'moral purpose' in business and politics The comments by Mr Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, will be seen as an attempt to position himself as a future party leader. Labour's Stephen Pound accused the London Mayor of 'breath-taking cheek' Last night Labour's Stephen Pound, who is fighting to defend a nearby seat, said: 'I'm thinking of a sentence with the words pot, kettle and black in it.' 'It seems that Boris's motto is \"do as I say, not as I do\". It really is breath-taking cheek. He obviously has a different definition of \"moral\" to most of my constituents.' In 2004, Mr Johnson admitted a four-year affair with the journalist Petronella Wyatt while he was married to his second wife Marina, with whom he has four children. Five years later he fathered a child by Helen Macintyre, an unpaid adviser in the London Assembly. Mr Johnson spoke about morality in an interview with the London Evening Standard, saying he believed wealth creation was there to fund public services such as schools and hospitals. He said: 'I think this country was harrowed by the experience of mass unemployment in the early Eighties. 'One of the absolute moral triumphs of this Coalition government has been to get us through the worst recession for 50 years without seeing a return to those levels of unemployment.'",

The former Illinois governor has return to his roots while inside and has been photographed with his still full head of hair a shocking white color rather than the boot polish black that was his trademark as a politician. Blagojevich was infamously caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected president in 2008. Fade to gray: Once famed for his mop of blacker than black hair, disgraced Democrat Rod Blagojevich, 58, has really let his haircare regime go while he serves his prison time Back in his days as governor of Illinois, Blagojevich was famed for his boot polish black hair He was impeached and removed from office by the state Legislature in early 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges. Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver. The photos, the first of Blagojevich in prison, were first published by the National Enquirer. The photos show the former governor sitting at a desk, reading a book and wearing glasses and sitting outside in shorts and a wife beater shirt. While he continues to awaiting word on a last-ditch appeal, Blagojevich has daily contact with his family and teaches the history of war battles to other inmates, his attorney said. Last July lawyers attempted to argue that a high court ruling in McCutcheon v. the Federal Election Commission in April 2014 bolstered their view that Blagojevich was engaged in legal, run-of-the-mill political horse trading, not corruption. The McCutcheon ruling, they argued, found that soliciting contributions crosses the line into corruption only when a politician makes a clear, explicit promise to take official action in return for a donation. Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver after he was caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected president In that context, defense attorneys said the trial judge was wrong to set a lower standard for jurors by telling them, to convict, they only needed to find that Blagojevich sought donations 'knowing or believing' it would be given for some official act. But government attorneys responded saying that Blagojevich's legal team hadn't correctly characterized the Supreme Court's findings in McCutcheon. 'The decision provides no support for Blagojevich's argument on appeal,' the two-page filing said.  'Nothing in the (McCutcheon) decision suggests that an exchange of contributions for specific official acts is quid pro quo corruption only if the arrangement is stated 'explicitly' or 'expressly.'' The Chicago-based appellate court has been considering Blagojevich's appeal for more than a year months. It's unclear when it might issue a decision.",

The Switzerland international joined the Italians from Bayern Munich in January for a fee in the region of \u00a312million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract. The 23-year-old made a fine start to his Inter career but has tailed off in recent weeks and has found himself dropped to the bench for the previous two Serie A matches. Xherdan Shaqiri joined Inter Milan from Bayern Munich in the January transfer window And it has been suggested that Inter are looking to offload the attacking midfielder at the end of the season, but Mancini has rubbished the speculation insisting Shaqiri can have a big future in Italy. 'This Shaqiri thing is completely made up,' he told reporters. 'We bought Shaqiri last January because we think that he can have a big future at Inter. Then during the season, there might be a moment when a player's form drops, and there are other players that in that moment are able to step in. So that's the only situation going on right now. 'Shaqiri has our full confidence. He is our player. Then he has also changed his team, so it's normal that he might struggle at a certain stage. Shaqiri has been dropped to the bench by Roberto Mancini in recent matches 'It's not that he can join a new club and altogether be the one that single-handedly wins games by himself. 'He will always have a drop in form at a certain stage so in that moment there are other players ready to step in - they are normally there for that reason. So one only plays when he deserves to play.  'We bought Shaqiri because we believe in his qualities,' Mancini added. The Inter boss insists Shaqiri will not be leaving the club despite reports to the contrary 'Then if Bayern [Munich] decided to sell him, it's because they have so many players that eventually they have reached the conclusion that Shaqiri is a young player and that he needs to play.

' the range in value depends on the bull it comes from , ' she added . ' some genetic qualities are more highly sought after than others , so the higher priced semen is coming from maybe an award winning bull or a quality that is sought after .

' it 's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption , than to try and work off the energy after you 've taken it in , ' he said . lawrence is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat . he advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eating part of your lifestyle so that you can indulge in treats every now and then . ' what we 're trying to encourage people to do is make better lifestyle choices ; to eat treat foods in moderation and to make sure they are physically active most of the time . that way when holidays , like easter , come around they do n't have to feel like they have to deny themselves , ' he said .",

' in a statement , the port of seattle expressed its sympathies to afoa and his family for the accident . the agency says it 's reviewing the decision . if it decides to appeal the verdict , it could delay payment of afoa 's award .",
